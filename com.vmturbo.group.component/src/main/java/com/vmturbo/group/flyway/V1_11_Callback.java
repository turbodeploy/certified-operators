/**
 * This callback adjusts, if necessary, the Flyway-recorded checksum for the V1.11 migration.
 *
 * <p>The migration as originally created contained a comment that started with "--" without a
 * trailing space. This is supported by the version of Flyway we are currently using, but will
 * not be supported by later versions, since it is not allowed by MySQL.</p>
 *
 * <p>See  details <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/ansi-diff-comments.html">
 * here</a>.</p>
 *
 * <p>We have replaced the migration file so that it now includes the required space, but we have
 * deployed the faulty migration file to some customers, and so its checksum is now recorded in
 * the flyway versions table, and this will cause future upgrades to fail, since the checksum of
 * the corrected file will not match the recorded checksum and pre-migration validation will fail.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>This class implements a pre-validation callback method that checks corrects the V1.11 checksum
 * if it is incorrect, thereby allowing validation - and migrations - to succeed.</p>
