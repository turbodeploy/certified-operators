/**
 * A graph built from the topology.
 *
 * <p>The graph should be an immutable DAG (directed acyclic graph) though that is not enforced by
 * this interface.</p>
 *
 * <p>The graph is constructed by following consumes/provides relations established by the
 * commodities bought and sold among the entities in the topology, as well as the explicit
 * connection relationships in the topology.</p>
 *
 * <p>The graph does NOT permit parallel edges. That is, an entity consuming multiple commodities
 * from the same provider results in only a single edge between the two in the graph.</p>
 *
 * <p>The objects within the graph's entities may be edited, but the graph is
 * immutable otherwise. Note that the edits made to the objects in the vertices should not modify
 * topological relationships or the graph will become out of sync with its members. This means that
 * commodities bought and sold by entities should not be modified in a way that they change which
 * entities are buying or selling commodities to each other.</p>
