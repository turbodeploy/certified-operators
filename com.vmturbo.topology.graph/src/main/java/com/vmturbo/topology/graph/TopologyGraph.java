/**
 * A graph built from the topology.
 * The graph should be an immutable DAG (directed acyclic graph) though that is not enforced by this interface.
 *
 * The graph is constructed by following consumes/provides relations established by the commodities
 * bought and sold among the entities in the topology, as well as the explicit
 * connection relationships in the topology.
 *
 * The graph does NOT permit parallel edges. That is, an entity consuming multiple commodities
 * from the same provider results in only a single edge between the two in the graph.
 *
 * The objects within the graph's entities may be edited, but the graph is
 * immutable otherwise. Note that the edits made to the objects in the vertices
 * should not modify topological relationships or the graph will become out of synch with its members.
 * This means that commodities bought and sold by entities should not be modified in a way that they change
 * which entities are buying or selling commodities to each other.
 *
 * See {@link TopologyGraphEntity} for further details on the entities in the {@link TopologyGraph}.
