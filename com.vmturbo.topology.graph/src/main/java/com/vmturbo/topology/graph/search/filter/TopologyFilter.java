/**
 * A generic filter that can be applied to a stream of entities in the graph
 * to produce an output stream of entities where the output stream members match
 * some criteria associated with the filter.
 *
 * Note that the size of the output stream may be smaller than, the same size as,
 * or larger than the input stream.
 *
 * Filters are designed to be composed together to resolveDynamicGroup entities (entities)
 * that match specific criteria.
 *
 * See Search.proto for the criteria used to define filters.
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTE FOR ALL IMPLEMENTING SUBCLASSES:
 * All TopologyFilter operations must be safe to run on parallel streams.
 * That is, no filter application may maintain any internal state that would
 * make its {@link #apply(Stream, TopologyGraph)} method unsafe to run concurrently.
 *
 * @param <E> The type of {@link TopologyGraphEntity} the filter works with.
