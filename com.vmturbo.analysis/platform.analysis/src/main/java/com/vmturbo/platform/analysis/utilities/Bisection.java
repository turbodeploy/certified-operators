         * representable floating-point numbers in the interval. We can have up to 2⁶⁴ of those, so
         * up to 64 iterations.
         *
         * In order to do this, we need to have a function f that maps the interval's endpoints a
         * and b to integers f(a) and f(b) in such a way that ∀x∈(a,b), f(x)∈(f(a),f(b)) and vice
         * versa. The `asLong` above is such a function.
         *
         * Note that the `asLong` function above maps both positive and negative 0.0 to 0L. If the
         * `continuousFunction` mapped positive and negative 0.0 to different values (e.g. 1/x
         * does), that could lead to problems, but this can't happen in the interval of interest
         * because bisection in general requires that the function be continuous in the interval.
