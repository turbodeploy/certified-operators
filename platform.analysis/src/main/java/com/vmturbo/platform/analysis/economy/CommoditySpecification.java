 * A detailed, exact statement of particulars about a commodity a buyer needs to buy (but may not be
 * currently buying) or a seller is able to sell (but may not be currently selling).
 *
 * <p>
 *  When a buyer sets out to buy a set of commodities he needs to specify what kind of commodities
 *  he needs e.g. he may need CPU and not Storage and he may also need a certain quality of it like
 *  e.g. a 4 core CPU might be enough, but a 2 core CPU might be insufficient.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *  Likewise, when a seller sets out to sell stuff, he needs a way to specify what kind of
 *  commodities are available to prospective buyers. e.g. he may be able to offer CPU with 1 to 8
 *  cores and Memory.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *  In order for a buyer to be satisfied by a seller, each commodity specification of the buyer must
 *  be satisfied by one commodity specification of the seller.
