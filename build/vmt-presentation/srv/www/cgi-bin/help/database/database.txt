Account Privileges	]> &Product_Short; accounts includes the Role and Type settings to specify access privileges. You can use these to set up different types of user accounts. For example, the same &Product_Short; server can support users who: Perform &Product_Short; administration tasks Modify the virtual environment Use &Product_Short; to monitor the environment Access small parts of the environment as Service Provider clients By combining Role and Type in a user account, you can set up access privileges that support these and other users’ needs. Account type provides a way to limit account privileges so users can see only virtual resources. This is useful for service providers who want their customers to use &Product_Short;, but don’t want to expose information about any physical resources in the environment. In this way, a service provider can use &Product_Short; to give customers a window into the resources they have purchased, but not expose information the service provider would rather keep private. &Product_Short; provides the following user account types: Dedicated — Unlimited user type A user who is focused on the overall virtual environment, or who is an administrator of the &Product_Short; appliance. For example, a service provider would set up dedicated accounts for its IT staff. A dedicated user can have any of the user roles in &Product_Short;. When you create a dedicated user account, you can optionally specify a scope. Shared — Limited user type A user who is focused on a subset of the virtual environment. For example, a service provider would create a shared account for a customer who has purchased a set virtual of resources. When you create a shared user account, you must also specify a scope to limit the inventory that the shared user can access. Note that a shared user can only have an Observer or Advisor role. An advisor can see the To Do list, but cannot perform any actions via &Product_Short;. In addition, a shared user only has access to the Inventory view. Role determines what &Product_Short; features the user can access. You can set a role for individual accounts as well as group accounts. For group accounts, any member of the group who logs in with this account will assume the given role. You can choose from the following: Observer The user can use the Home and Inventory views. This is the most restrictive role. Advisor The user can use the Home, Inventory, and Plan views, but cannot accept recommended actions. Automator The user can use all the views except Admin and Policy. This user can accept recommended actions, but cannot perform administrative tasks. Administrator The user can use all Operations Manager views.					
Action_Categories.xml	Action_Categories.xml	158615	10	3131	&Product_Short; organizes entries in the To Do log into different categories....	Action_Categories.xml	]> Action Categories &Product_Short; organizes entries in the To Do log into different categories. These categories do not strictly define the severity of an issue, but they indicate the nature of the issue. Prevention &Product_Short; constantly monitors conditions, and works to keep your environment running in the optimal operating zone. As it finds issues that risk moving the environment out of this zone, it places these issues in the Prevention category. You should attend to these issues, and perform the associated actions. If you do not, the environment may drift out of the operating zone, and the QoS for some services may be put at risk. Actions Risks/Opportunities Move VM Start VM or PM &lt;Resource> Congestion High resource utilization on the named VM, host, or datastore. For example, CPU congestion or Memory congestion can occur on a VM or physical machine. Excess latency on a data stream. For example, an IOPs bottleneck can occur on a datastore. Workload Balancing Excess workload on a given physical machine that can be addressed by moving a VM to another host. Performance Assurance Ultimately, the reason to keep your environment running within the optimal operating zone is to assure performance and meet QoS goals. When &Product_Short; detects conditions that directly put QoS at risk, it places the associated actions and risks in the Performance Assurance category. You can consider these critical conditions, and you should execute the recommended actions as soon as possible. Actions Risks/Opportunities Connect a new application (to virtual application server) Provision a new VM, PM, Datastore Increase number of VCPUs Decrease number of VCPUs Increase resource Reduce resource &lt;Resource> Congestion High utilization of application managed by a load balancer. High utilization of resources on VM, PM, or datastore. Compliance A virtual environment can include policies that limit workload placement or availability of resources. It’s possible that the environment configuration violates these defined policies. It’s also possible that an entity is mis-configured in some way. For example, a VM might be configured to access a network that is not available in its current cluster. In such cases, &Product_Short; identifies the violation and recommends actions that bring the entity back into compliance. Actions Risks/Opportunities Move VM Provision VM, PM, Datastore, Network Placement Violation The placement of a VM is in violation of an &Product_Short; policy or an imported Placement Policy. Misconfiguration The configuration violates discovered requirements. For example, a VM is configured to access a network that is not available from the current cluster. Efficiency Improvement Efficient utilization of resources is an important part of running in the optimal operating zone. Running efficiently maximizes your investment in hardware and reduces cost. When &Product_Short; discovers underutilized resources, it recommends actions to consolidate your operations. For example, it can recommend that you move certain VMs onto a different host. This can free a physical machine to be shut down. There are times when &Product_Short; suspends a VM in order to free up resources for a critical application. When those resources are no longer stressed by the critical application, &Product_Short; can restart the suspended VM. This is a special type of efficiency improvement—rather than consolidating workload and shutting down unused machines, this action restarts a suspended VM to increase resource utilization and provide more services. Actions Risks/Opportunities Disconnect Virtual App Move VM Suspend VM Delete VM Terminate VM Reduce resource Restart suspended VM Overprovisioning Excess resource capacity in a PM or datastore.

VM Actions	]> Action Modes When &Product_Short; uncovers potential bottlenecks, over provisioning, or other issues, it can then identify and perform actions that will prevent those issues from occurring, and keep the environment in the Optimal Operating Zone. You can specify action modes that determine how &Product_Short; handles the actions it identifies for switches, disk arrays, datastores, hosts, and VMs. Action Automation Support &Product_Short; doesn’t automate the same actions equally for all technologies. This is because the underlying technologies do not provide the same degree of automation. For example, assume you set the Suspend action to be automated for all VMs. In that case, &Product_Short; can automate suspension for VMs managed by vCenter and XenServer, but it cannot automatically suspend VMs managed by Hyper-V. Note that &Product_Short; will perform automation for the VMs that it can, and recommend suspension for Hyper-V VMs. The following table lists actions &Product_Short; supports on each entity, showing whether the underlying technology supports automation, or recommended-only actions. indicates full automation support indicates recommended-only actions Action vCenter XenServer Hyper-V RHEV Start Move Suspend Remove (Terminate) Change (Move to Different Storage) Add Storage Remove Storage Reconfigure (Change network and storage configurations) Resize (Change VCPU and memory capacities) Action vCenter XenServer Hyper-V RHEV Start Suspend Remove (Terminate) Provision Action vCenter XenServer Hyper-V RHEV Remove (Terminate) Provision For direct actions on VCloud Director and CloudStack virtual datacenters, &Product_Short; only supports resize actions. However, &Product_Short; does automate actions for the underlying entities (VMs and hosts) that are managed by the virtual datacenter. However, note that CloudStack does not support VMotion of storage. Action VCD CloudStack Resize (Change VCPU and memory capacities) Action NetApp Start Move Suspend Provision Resize Action UCS Start Move Suspend Provision Resize Action Mode Settings For each action &Product_Short; can perform you can specify the action mode, or how it will handle the action. &Product_Short; supports the following action modes: Disabled — Do not recommend or perform the action Recommended — Recommend the action so a user can perform it using the given hypervisor or by other means Manual — Recommend the action, and provide the option to perform that action through the &Product; user interface Automated — &Product_Short; performs the action automatically The following figure shows override settings for a group of Development hosts. In this case, &Product_Short; will automatically start physical machines in this group. To set modes for all hosts in the environment, you should make global host settings for the given actions (see Global Settings ). Setting Action Modes for a Group To get the best results from &Product_Short;’s Intelligent Workload Management, you should set as many actions as possible to Automated . In that case, you should set the actions to Automated at the global level. If some clusters run applications that are highly critical, you can override the global setting for those clusters, and set them to Manual . Scheduling Action Restriction Windows For some clusters or groups of devices, you might want to automate actions, but only during off-peak hours. &Product_Short; includes a scheduling utility that you can use to specify time windows when you can restrict the action mode for a given scope of devices. You can use this to allow or disallow automation for a given window of time. The &Product_Short; Economic Scheduling Engine continually calculates actions that cause your environment to converge on the Optimal Operating Zone. These actions are in response to the environment at a given point in time. When you restrict the automation of a given action to a certain time window, &Product_Short; will only calculate and perform actions that are appropriate for the environment during that scheduled window. You should review manual actions during time periods when automation is restricted, so you can manually adjust the environment in response to peak states. By default, the global settings for all actions have no restriction windows set for them. If you globally set the VM Move action to Automated, then &Product; will automatically execute any recommended VM move actions whenever they arise — 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Action restriction widows modify this, for global policies or as overrides to global policies scoped to specific groups. (For information about policy scope, see Global Settings .) For example, assume you want to always automate Resize for all but the most critical VMs. You would set Resize VMs to Automated at a global level. Then for a critical cluster, you could set a restriction window that overrides the automation (sets Resize to Manual) during peak hours (9:00 to 5:00 m-f). You can also restrict action modes in reverse fashion. For example, if you want to automate only one set of VMs, you can set Resize to Manual at the global level, and for one cluster you can schedule it to be Automated for a given time window. Creating a Simple Action Restriction Window To schedule a time window for an automated action: Set the scope for this action. You can set global scope, or scope for a given cluster. Click View Schedule to open the restrictions windows panel and then click New Action Restriction Window . You can select the window start date beforehand in the calendar, or set it as you create the policy. Specify the settings for this restriction window. The date range determines how many days the window will “open”, or in be in effect. You should keep the following points in mind: A non-recurring window has a start date, and no end date. The window will open for the day you specify as the start date. For recurring windows you specify a date range. The window will open during times within that range. For monthly recurrence, the window will open one day each month — on the day you set for the Start Date. But the window recurrence remains in effect until the End Date. For example, if you specify the 1January 1st 20123 for the start date, and the December 31st 2013 for the end date, the window will open on the first day of each month for that year. For any given day, the window can be in effect from 00:00 through 24:00. If you want an action mode to span two days, you must specify two restriction windows. For example, to enable automation from 22:00 to 06:00, you must create two windows — On from 22:00 to 24:00, and another from 0:00 to 06:00. Note that you can set different label colors for your restriction windows. This is a good way to track windows of a similar type. For example, you could use red for windows on critical clusters, and green for windows on prototyping clusters. When you have the settings you want, click Create . The restriction window appears in the calendar. When you select a day in the calendar, the Action Restriction Windows list shows all the items for that day. Hover over an item to display details in a tooltip. Tie-break Results It’s possible that different restriction windows will affect the same resource instance. In that case the most conservative setting wins. The following list is from most conservative to most aggressive: Disabled Recommended Manual Automated

When you add these targets, &Product_Short; can discover the disk arrays they manage. Adding a Storage Controller Target To add a storage controller as a target, specify the IP address for the storage controller, and credentials for a user that has API privileges on the storage controller. &Product_Short; discovers the disk arrays and IO modules that are managed by the storage controller. NetApp filers run on the Data ONTAP operating system. To discover and manage NetApp disk arrays, &Product_Short; must have a role and user account that grants privileges to execute certain commands via the filer’s API. The filer administrator must configure the role and user account. When you add the NetApp filer as a target, you enter credentials for the user that has the necessary role. Then &Product_Short; can log into the filer to perform discovery, analysis, and perform actions. To specify this information, log into the NetApp filer with a command-line shell. Then use Data ONTAP commands to create a role with API privileges, a group that exposes that role, and a user that is a member of that group. Create a role with API privileges Enter the following command: useradmin role add role_name -a capability1[,capability2 ...] This role will give &Product_Short; the ability to execute every API command that is supported by the filer OS. For security reasons, you should create the role with a comma-delimited list of API capabilities. For the minimal list of capabilities you must give &Product_Short;, see Required Capabilities for Operations Manager Access of NetApp Filers . Create a group and assign the role to it Enter the following command: useradmin group add group_name [-c comments] -r role_name For example: useradmin add VMTurboGroup -r VMTurboRole This creates a group that exposes the role named VMTurboRole. Create a user that is a member of the group Enter the following command: useradmin user add user_name -g group_name For example useradmin user add VMTurboUser -g VMTurboGroup This will create a new user that is a member of the VMTurboGroup. When you execute the above command, the OS will prompt you for the user’s password. After you provide the password, the OS creates the user account. You can then use those credentials when you specify the given filer as a NetApp target. To securely administer users, groups, and roles, you should not configure roles with global access unless you have a specific need. For &Product_Short; to access NetApp filers, you can provide it with a subset of the Data ONTAP API capabilities.

In addition, the user that you specify must be one of the server’s WBEM Scripting Locater owners. Each Hyper-V server requires specific permissions to allow management via WMI. These permissions are set in the host’s WBEM Scripting Locater registry key. To set the permissions, edit the registry key to add owners and grant them full control. To add an owner to the Hyper-V server’s registry key: Launch regedit on that machine as Administrator Find the following registry key: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{76A64158-CB41-11D1-8B02-00600806D9B6} Right click the key and choose Permissions Click Advanced and display the Owner tab In the owners list, add the user you want to allow to connect to the machine Click Ok Highlight the user and grant Full Control Once you have done this you can specify the Hyper-V server as an &Product_Short; target, using credentials for an owner that has Full Control privileges. Adding Multiple Hyper-V Servers You can add Hyper-V targets as one at a time, by providing the host name or IP address of each. If you have many such Hyper-V servers, it is more efficient to use a single command to add all the Hyper-V servers that are in a cluster. To do this, provide the following information: Host Name or IP Address — Any valid address for a Hyper-V server within the cluster Full Domain Name — The full domain name for the given cluster Username and Password — Credentials that are valid for all the Hyper-V servers in the cluster (see above for information about enabling WMI management) Adding a Hyper-V Target When you specify a full domain name for the cluster, &Product_Short; discovers all the Hyper-V servers within that cluster and adds them as targets. In addition, &Product_Short; monitors your environment and automatically adds new targets whenever it discovers a new Hyper-V server in the cluster.

These service types appear in the &Product_Short; supply chain as virtual applications. To enable discovery of virtual applications, you must configure load balancer discovery. Configuring Load Balancer Discovery After you add a load balancer as a target, you must configure &Product_Short; to discover the virtual applications that load balancer manages. The steps to do this are: Specify discovery for the applications the load balancer will manage The load balancer manages workload across instances of running applications in your environment. &Product_Short; must be configured to discover and manage these running applications before it can recognize that they are managed by the load balancer. For example, To specify discovery of a specific application, you define its application signature and then provide credentials for the given protocol (WMI, SNMP, or JMX) that &Product_Short; can use to access the VMs that host the application. For more information, see Application Discovery . Assign application signatures to specific virtual applications &Product_Short; discovers the virtual applications that the load balancer uses to manage applications. After you have specified signatures and discovery for the applications you want the load balancer to manage, you can then assign those application signatures to specific virtual applications. For more information, see Load Balancer Discovery . For example, assume the load balancer uses virtual applications named web and sql to manage web servers and SQL databases. Also assume that you have defined an application signature named IIS for IIS Web Server applications, and another signature named SQL for Microsoft SQL Server applications. In that case, you need to map the IIS signature to the web virtual application, and SQL to the sql virtual application. Now &Product_Short; can discover these applications and represent them as the running components within the load balancer.

Users can log onto these instances “locally” as they normally would, and use their GUIs to perform administration tasks, review and perform recommended actions, run plans, or perform any other task a user can perform with &Product_Short;. But aggregation offers more. The aggregation instance treats the underlying instances as its target servers. Users can log onto the aggregation instance and use the GUI to manage the aggregated environment by executing recommended actions, viewing aggregated dashboards and summary panels, and performing other tasks. You perform these tasks through the aggregating GUI, but you can effect changes on the inventory managed by the underlying &Product_Short; instances. An aggregating instance cannot manage hypervisors and aggregated target instances at the same time. All the targets of an aggregating instance must be target instances of &Product_Short;. Versions and Licensing for Aggregation The aggregating instance of &Product_Short; must have a Cloud Edition license. The underlying target instances can run with either a Cloud Edition or Enterprise Edition license. Note that all instances of &Product_Short; in the aggregation architecture must be running the same version. If you update the version, you should update all instances in the architecture. The earliest version of &Product_Short; that supports aggregation is 3.2-19954.

Aggregated_User_Accounts_and_Login.xml	]> Aggregated User Accounts and Login When you create a user account on the aggregating instance, the same account gets pushed to all the target instances. In this way, a user with an account on the aggregating instance can then log onto any of the underlying target instances. For example, a user can open target instances from the aggregating instance GUI, and then set policies for those targets. Even though you can create an account from an aggregating instance, and then push it to the target instances, user accounts are stored locally on each instance. As a result, accounts can get out of sync. If a target was added to your aggregating instance after your account was already created , then you won’t necessarily have an account on the new target. To remedy this situation, ask the administrator of the target to create an account for you with settings (username, password, role, etc.) that are identical to your current aggregating account. Active Directory Authentication For Active Directory accounts, user authentication works as you would expect: When you create a user account on the aggregating instance, that user account gets pushed down to the underlying instances. You can then log into the underlying instances using the same credentials. The Active Directory domain and server specifications are local to each &Product_Short; instance. In this way, each instance can use authentication that is local to its domain, but support the authentication of the same user.

Aggregation_Details.xml	]> Aggregation Details The aggregation instance provides a view of the whole environment that is being managed by the target instances. The aggregating instance requests data from the target instances as its GUI needs the data. The following list provides details of how the aggregation instance manages data from the target instances. System-defined Groups &Product_Short; automatically groups devices in your environment into clusters and other groups. For example, it lists datastores by storage type, or VMs by storage. The aggregating instance adds the aggregated devices to these groups as appropriate. For example, if the different target instances all include iSCSI disks, then the aggregating instance shows all of these disks in the same iSCSI group. You can select these groups or items in these groups to set the scope of the aggregating instance. Custom Groups The aggregating instance displays all the custom groups that are defined in the target instances. You can select these groups or items in these groups to set the scope of the aggregating instance. You can create groups on the aggregating instance that include devices from different target instances. Groups you create on the aggregating instance do not have any effect on groups that are defined on target instances. To Do List On the aggregating instance, the To Do list shows recommended actions for all the target instances. If manual execution for the action is enabled on the target instance, then you can select that action and execute it from the aggregating instance. This sends a message to the corresponding target instance, which executes then the action. &Tab_Home; View The Project Cluster Resources dashboard is not aggregated. This dashboard displays a list of target instances — You can log into these instances to project cluster resources. For the other dashboards, the data you see shows a combination of the target instances. For example, the Assure Service Performance dashboard shows information for the total of all hosts in your environment. As you set the scope of the dashboard, you can choose from all the groups and clusters in the environment. &Tab_Observe; View The data you see in the summary panels shows a combination of the target instances. For example if your target instances each manage a number of LSASS applications, the navigation list will show the total of all these applications under the heading for LSASS. You can select groups to set the scope of this view. &Tab_Plan; View Plans are not aggregated. The &Tab_Plan; view displays a list of target instances. You can log into these instances to run plans on them. &Tab_Deploy; View The &Tab_Deploy; view displays a list of target instances. You can log into these instances to deploy VMs on them. &Tab_Optimize; View The data you see in this view shows a combination of the target instances. You can select groups to set the scope of this view. &Tab_Admin; View On the aggregating instance, this view supports the following tasks: License Configuration License configuration for the aggregating instance gets pushed down to the target instances. For information about applying licenses, see License Configuration . User Authentication Configuration You can manage user accounts for the aggregating instance. These accounts get pushed down to the target instances as well. For more information, see Aggregated User Accounts and Login and User Authentication Configuration . Maintenance Maintenance actions such as software updates and diagnostics are for the aggregation instance, only. The target instances must perform their own maintenance activities. For more information, see Maintenance . &Tab_Policy; View The &Tab_Policy; view displays a list of target instances. You can log into these instances to specify policies on them. Reports The Reporting button displays a list of target instances. You can log into these instances to run their reports. Individual devices in the navigation tree include buttons to generate reports on demand. When you click this icon, the aggregating instance passes the request to the appropriate target instance, which generates the report.

Applications.xml	Applications.xml	158615	9	2861	In a virtualized environment, an application is a process running on...	Application Discovery	]> Applications In a virtualized environment, an application is a process running on a VM. Applications typically serve human users, or other applications. They provide transactions to their users. Synopsis Budget: An application gains its budget as a function of its activity, as measured by utilization of transactions. The more active an application is (the more transactions the application performs), the more &Product_Short; assumes the application is selling its services to a user. Provides: Transactions to other applications, to load balancer Virtual Application Servers, and to end users. Consumes: VM resources, including VCPU, VMem, and VStorage. Discovered through: &Product_Short; uses WMI, SNMP, or JMX to discover applications through the current target hypervisors. For information, see Adding and Removing Target Virtual Management Servers . By default, &Product_Short; discovers the following applications: Application Name Description LSASS Microsoft Active Directory services IIS Microsoft Internet Information Services XenDesktop Citrix XenDesktop VMView VMWare View MSSQL Microsoft SQL Server SharePoint Microsoft Sharepoint Server Guest Load The resources that &Product_Short; has not assigned to any specific application (for more information, see Guest Load ) In addition, your installation of &Product_Short; might be configured to discover other applications running in your environment. For more information, see Application Discovery . Guest Load The Apps_GuestLoad item is a special entry in the Applications hierarchy. This item tracks the resources that &Product_Short; has not assigned to any specific application. This can occur for the following reasons: You do not have the licenses required to support Application monitoring In this case, &Product_Short; lists all the consumed VM resources in the Apps_GuestLoad entry—this is the only entry under Applications. &Product_Short; fails to discover some applications In this case, &Product_Short; displays entries for the applications it has discovered, and lists the VM resources that are not accounted for under Apps_GuestLoad. VM resources are devoted to infrastructure, and not part of any application &Product_Short; lists these resources under Apps_GuestLoad, and provides entries for the applications it has discovered. &fmv18; monitors the following resources for an application: VMem The percentage utilization of the VMem allocated for the hosting VM, measured in Kbytes. VCPU The percentage utilization of the VCPU allocated for the hosting VM, measured in Mhz. Transaction (transactions per second) The percentage utilization of the allocated transactions per second for the given virtual application. For environments that include load balancers, &Product_Short; recommends and performs Bind/Unbind actions on applications. These actions increase or decrease capacity for a given load balancer. Other than Bind/Unbind, &Product_Short; doesn’t perform actions on applications. Instead, it performs actions on the host VMs. If utilization is high enough on an application, &Product_Short; can create a new copy of the host VM. When an application is idle, it loses budget. Ultimately, if the budget falls enough, &Product_Short; will suspend or terminate the host VM. You can declare that an application is critical. Doing this gives the application unlimited budget, so its host VM will never be suspended. For more information, see Application Priority .

Application_Discovery.xml	Application_Discovery.xml	158545	14	5835	&Product_Short; discovers applications via WMI (for applications on Windows VMs) and...	Application_Discovery.xml	]> Application Discovery &Product_Short; discovers applications via WMI (for applications on Windows VMs) and SNMP or JMX (for applications on other VMs). To keep the list of discovered applications current, &fmv1; polls the environment every 20 minutes. For SNMP monitoring, &Product_Short; receives trap messages via port 162. For &Product_Short; to perform application discovery, it requires: The appropriate agent running on the given VM For VMs running Windows, the VM must have a WMI agent running on it For SNMP discovery, VMs must run Linux, and the VM must have a running SNMP agent For JMX discovery, the JVM on the virtual machine must be started with a jmxremote port VM Access Credentials for the given protocol (WMI, SNMP, or JMX) Application Signatures to identify the applications you want to discover and manage Application signatures identify running processes that belong to a specific application. &Product_Short; ships with a default set of application signatures — you can add others to the list. Default Application Discovery By default, &Product_Short; discovers the following applications: Application Name Description MSSQL Microsoft SQL Server IIS Microsoft Internet Information Services LSASS Microsoft Active Directory services XenDesktop Citrix XenDesktop VMView VMWare View SharePoint Microsoft Sharepoint Server Guest Load The resources that &Product_Short; has not assigned to any specific application (for more information, see Guest Load ) Application Signatures An application signature is a search string that matches process names. A single application may launch a number of processes to perform its job. Rather than tracking each process as a separate application, &Product_Short; can group these processes and monitor the group as a single application. Each process must have a unique name, but each process name typically includes part of the name of the main application, or some other text that identifies it as part of the overall application. This name that’s shared in all the process names is the application signature . Note that the same application signature is valid for WMI and SNMP application discovery. When you make the list of signatures, you do not need to identify what protocol will be used to monitor them. As &Product_Short; scans a VM for application processes, it uses the full list of signatures, no matter what the operating system is for that VM. To specify an application signature: Select Application Discovery to display the editor. Create a new application signature. Provide an application name. Application names should be unique. If you provide a name that is identical to a default application name (as described in Default Application Discovery ), then &Product_Short; will use your custom application signature when grouping application processes. Enter regular expressions to identify the characters that must be in a Windows process name. You can also specify characters that must not be in the process name. Any process name that satisfies the application signature identifies a member of the given application. For example, assume the following strings: - Match: s.* - No-match: sq.* In this case, the signature would match all process names that begin with 's' , except those that begin with 'sq' . Creating Application Signatures VM Access Credentials To discover and monitor applications, &Product_Short; uses WMI on VMs running Windows, and SNMP or JMX on other VMs. You must provide valid credentials for any of the VMs that host applications you want to monitor. For WMI application discovery and management, the given target hypervisor requires specific permissions that allow WMI access. For more information, see Adding Hyper-V Servers as Targets . You select VM groups and set specific credentials for those VMs. You can select a top-level group to provide one set of credentials for all the VMs in the inventory, and then select lower-level groups to override the more general settings (for more about settings overrides, see Policy Scope ). Note that you set credentials to groups of VMs, not to individual VMs. To discover applications on all the VMs in a group, all those VMs must honor the same credentials. If the VMs in default groupings don’t all have the same credentials, you can create custom groups to keep the same credentials together. For information about creating custom groups, see Group Management . You can specify WMI, SNMP, and JMX access credentials for the same group. For example, if the group includes VMs running Windows and Linux, you should specify both a valid windows admin account, and a valid SNMP community. For all VMs in the group, if they are running Windows then they must honor the provided admin credentials; for other operating systems, they must honor the provided SNMP community. The settings to make are: Username: A user with admin rights on the machine Password: That user’s password SNMP Community: A community string that is valid on the machine JMX Protocol: Can be RMI or JMXMP JMX Port: The port number of the jmxremote port for the VM’s JVM JMX URL: The URL that &Product_Short; uses to establish a client connection with the VM’s JVM Retry Interval: The minimum amount of time to wait before trying to log into a machine again It’s common to configure machines so they will lock out any login attempts after a certain number of unsuccessful attempts. The lockout typically stays in effect for a given time (15 or 30 minutes, for example). &Product_Short; logs in to poll for applications every 20 minutes. You should set the retry interval to a value larger than the lockout time that is specified for the machine. This will avoid unnecessary lockouts in case the credentials you provide here are incorrect. The default retry interval value is 60 minutes. The following figure shows settings for the applications that run on VMs in a specific cluster. To set credentials for all VMs in the environment, you would select a top-level item in the Scope list. Setting Discovery Credentials for Applications in a Cluster Credentials are inherited. For example, you can select the top-level group Virtual Machines and provide one set of credentials. Then you can select lower-level groups and provide override credentials. The lowest-level credential specification wins. The following image shows settings for all VMs (the top-level group). This means that by default &Product_Short; will use these credentials when it performs application discovery on a VM: The next image shows settings for a specific VM. You cannot make settings on individual VMs, but you can see the username, and you can also see which group setting is in effect. In this case, &Product_Short; will use these credentials for application discovery on that VM. Note that the Application Discovery table shows where this VM’s credentials are set. In this case, they are set in the top-level group (Virtual Machines). It’s possible for one VM to belong to many groups. If you need to change the credentials for this machine, you know where they are currently set. You can create another group to set different credentials for this VM.

Application_Priority.xml	]> Application Priority Application priority determines the conditions under which &Product_Short; recommends to suspend or terminate a VM. Suspending a VM means powering it down, but leaving it in the in the hypervisor’s list of managed VMs. Terminating a VM means removing it from the hypervisor. When &Product_Short; recommends that you terminate a VM, this indicates that the VM is dormant, and no applications are running on it. Your environment may include some VMs that you never want to terminate. You might think that you can set all applications to Mission Critical as a way to direct that &Product_Short; never recommends termination. In fact, &Product_Short; can recommend that you terminate a dormant VM that has Mission Critical applications on it. If you want to never terminate, then you can disable the Terminate action for all VMs or for a group of VMs. For more information, see Action Modes . &Product_Short; monitors resource consumption, and works to keep Mission Critical applications running. If a Mission Critical application needs resources and none are immediately available, &Product_Short; may recommend suspending non-critical VMs to free up resources and make them available to the critical application. You can specify the priority for applications to be: Mission Critical The focus of &Product_Short; is to keep the applications running. For example, it will never suggest suspending the VM that hosts a mission critical application. Normal &Product_Short; may suggest suspending a VM that hosts normal applications to free up resources that a mission critical application might need. Low &Product_Short; does not consider the needs of low priority applications when calculating the optimal operating zone for your environment. You specify application priority to groups. The most important groups for application priority are: Applications Each group is named for a discovered application, and contains all the instances of that named application. Physical Machines For each physical machines, all the applications running on that machine. If a VM has any Mission Critical applications on it, &Product_Short; will always try to find resources for that VM, and will never recommend suspending it in order to free up resources. &Product_Short; can recommend terminating a VM with Mission Critical applications, if the VM is truly dormant. For a VM with all Normal applications, if the VM uses resources that are needed elsewhere, then &Product_Short; may recommend suspending this VM. For a VM with Low-priority applications, it can recommend to terminate the VM to free up resources. By default, all applications are Mission Critical (see the Global Setting for Application Priority ). For each VM &Product_Short; defines a Guest Load application. The Guest Load represents all consumption that &Product_Short; cannot assign to a specific application. This includes processes for the VM’s operating system. &Product_Short; ignores Guest Load priority when deciding how to free up resources. However, if a VM has only the Guest Load application on it, and that application is set to Low, then &Product_Short; may recommend terminating that VM. The following figure shows override settings for the applications hosted by use a specific physical machine. To set priority for all applications in the environment, you should make global settings for Application Priority (see Global Settings ). Setting Priority for the Applications on a Specific Host Tie-break Results When the same resource instance has conflicting settings, the most conservative setting wins.

Assure_Service_Performance.xml	]> Assure Service Performance This dashboard illustrates how to assure workloads have the resources they need to perform well. Use this dashboard to prevent performance degradation. You can use this dashboard to inspect the workload and utilization of resources on hosts and on datastores. You can see how VMs utilize resources and what actions you can take to achieve an optimal workload distribution. If utilization levels present risks to the final QoS for end users, this dashboard points out the risks and gives you a list of actions you can take to correct the situation before any problems arise. The dashboard displays this information in the following panels: To Do This panel displays actions you can execute to maintain optimal operating conditions. You can toggle the panel between a To Do list and a list of current risks to service performance. (For a complete description of To Do panels, see To Do Lists - Maintaining QoS .) The To Do list shows actions that you can execute in the following ways: Automatically &Product_Short; performs the actions as it recommends them. You don’t need to do anything to perform these actions. Manually, through &Product_Short; &Product_Short; shows the actions in the To Do list, with active check boxes you can select. You select the actions to perform, and then click Apply . Externally, outside of &Product_Short; &Product_Short; recommends the action, but cannot execute it. Either an &Product_Short; policy specifies that the action cannot be executed, or there is no way for &Product_Short; to direct the hypervisor to perform the action. For example, there is no way for &Product_Short; add more memory to a physical machine. You execute these actions outside of &Product_Short;. You can specify action policies for VMs, hosts, storage devices, and cloud stacks. These policies determine how to execute each action. You can specify global policies for all entities of each type, and you can also specify policies for specific groups of entities. For more information, see Action Modes . Health The Health chart shows the current status of the physical machines in your environment. You can choose to chart host machines or storage. The pie chart shows the status of your physical devices. You can click the chart to open a heatmap that lists the status of each physical device. Projected Improvements The Projected Improvements chart shows the current state of your environment, compared to the target results you would achieve if you executed all the recommended actions in the To Do list. The bars show the current state, and the line chart shows the target results. You can set the chart to show data for the hosts or datastores in your environment. When charting hosts, you can select the following metrics to show in the chart: UI — The Utilization Index, a measure of the overall utilization of resources on the host Mem — The percentage of the host’s memory capacity that is utilized, measured in Kbytes CPU — The percentage of the host’s CPU capacity that is utilized, measured in MHz IO — The percentage of the host’s IO capacity that is utilized Net — The percentage of the host’s network throughput capacity that is utilized VMs per host — The number of VMs running on each host When charting datastores, you can show the following metrics: UI — The Utilization Index, a measure of the overall utilization of resources on the datastore Storage — The percentage of the storage capacity that is utilized IOPs — The percentage of the capacity for read and write IO operations per second that is utilized Latency — The percentage of latency capacity that is utilized, measured in ms To see precise utilization values, hover over a data point to display a tooltip. Displaying the Utilization Comparison Chart In the Projected Improvements chart, you can click the Details icon to open a Utilization Comparison chart for your environment. This chart is the same as the view you get in the &Tab_Optimize; view, minus the navigation panel. For information about this view, see The Optimize View . Optimal Operating Zone This chart projects how your environment can change over time from the current state to a state within the optimal operating zone (see The Optimal Operating Zone ). You can view projections for Memory and CPU utilization, aggregated for all the hosts in your environment. The chart shows the historical data that it uses to make the projection. You can drag the Time sliders to set dates for the historical data. The chart then projects the values for maximum, minimum, and average forward into a period of one week. This projection assumes you have accepted the actions in the To Do list. You should see the average trend toward the center of the optimal operating zone. The Max and Min values should trend toward the same point, indicating that the size of the operating zone is shrinking to within an acceptable range of deviations from the average.

Backup and Restore Via the &Product_Short; Backup Script	]> &Product_Short; Backup Procedures &fmv1; anticipates trouble-free use of &Product_Short;, but in most environments a regular backup schedule is recommended. You should be able to incorporate &Product_Short; backups in your schedule with minimal impact on your regular backup procedures. &Product_Short; is a real-time management and control application that performs the bulk of its analysis on in-memory data. Unlike many other products, &Product_Short; does not store operations-critical data about your environment on the file system or in a database. As a result, backups do not require the space necessary to store a complete listing of all the resources in your environment. The following describes the data that must be included in a backup: &Product_Short; historical database &Product_Short; uses historical data to chart past values, perform projections, provide baselines for plans, and display historical data in reports. This information is useful, and charts that display historical data rely on historical data. However, &Product_Short; performs workload management as soon as it discovers your topology, and does not rely on this information for operation. Retained reports &Product_Short; retains reports for a specified period of time — one year by default. Configuration files Configuration files define user accounts, policies, groups, target configurations, licensing, and other data that describes your installation. &Product_Short; includes a script that you can execute to run a backup. You can also can create a backup by saving a snapshot of the &Product_Short; virtual machine, or by including &Product_Short; in scheduled runs of a VM backup agent. The supplied backup and restore scripts perform backups of the critical &Product_Short; data — the historical database, retained reports, and configuration files. You can execute backups with no interruption to &Product_Short; processing. However, restore operations require the server to restart. The restore command restarts the &Product_Short; server as part of its execution. To perform a backup: Open a console on the &Product_Short; server and log in as root / vmturbo (these are the default credentials) Execute the following command: /srv/tomcat6/script/appliance/vmtbackup.sh -o [config|full] where config backs up just the configuration files, and full backs up the historical database, retained reports, and configuration files. The script generates the following backup file: /tmp/vmtbackup.zip Save a copy of the backup file to a safe location You should save copies of the backups in case the &Product_Short; virtual machine fails and cannot be recovered. In that case, you can use the saved copy to restore to a new installation of the appliance. The version of &Product_Short; to which you restore the backup must be the same as the version that generated the backup file. To restore a backup to an &Product_Short; installation: Make sure your most recent backup file is in the /tmp directory on the &Product_Short;server The backup file must be located in: /tmp/vmtbackup.zip Open a console on the &Product_Short; server and log in as root / vmturbo (these are the default credentials), and navigate to the root directory ( cd / ) Execute the following command: /srv/tomcat6/script/appliance/vmtrestore.sh -o [config|full] where config restores just the configuration files, and full restores the historical database, retained reports, and configuration files. To restore a backup if the &Product_Short; appliance has failed and cannot be recovered: Download a new server from the &fmv2; web site, and deploy it This server should be the same version as the version that you used to create the backup file you will restore. Copy your most recent backup file to in the /tmp directory on the newly installed server The backup file must be located in: /tmp/vmtbackup.zip Execute a restore command on the newly installed server It’s common to back up critical virtual machines by creating regular snapshots. If this is the method you prefer, you can include &Product_Short; appliances in your snapshot schedule. These backups will include all the information that is necessary to restore &Product_Short; to its original state. If you use VM backup agents to back up your environment, you can include the &Product_Short; appliance in that backup schedule. We have not tested specific backup agents, but we are not aware of any reported issues with their use.					
CapacityDashboard.xml	CapacityDashboard.xml	158826	5	1896	This dashboard answers the question, “How many VMs can I safely...	Cluster Resource Summary	]> Cluster Capacity This dashboard answers the question, “How many VMs can I safely add to a given cluster?” The dashboard shows how much extra capacity your clusters have as VM headroom . To calculate cluster capacity and headroom, &Product_Short; runs planning scenarios that take into account all the conditions in your current environment. The plan uses the Economic Scheduling Engine to identify the optimal workload distribution for each cluster. This can include moving your current VMs to other hosts within the given cluster, if such moves would result in a more desirable workload distribution. The result of the plan is a calculation of how many more VMs the cluster can support. By default &Product_Short; runs ten Capacity Plans per day. If you have more than ten clusters in your environment, when you first start &Product_Short; you will have to wait one or more days before all clusters appear in this dashboard. Tooltips in the Summary panel show when the plan was last run for each cluster. To calculate VM headroom, the plan must assume each additional VM has been allocated a certain capacity for its resources. To accomplish this, the plan uses a VM template as a profile for the VMs that fill the cluster’s headroom. For this reason, the count of VMs given for the headroom is an approximation based on that VM template. Summary This panel lists the clusters in your environment, showing the current count of VMs, physical machines and datastores in each cluster. The list also shows headroom — how many more VMs you can add to the cluster and still remain in the desired state. As you select a cluster in the panel, the dashboard updates to show data for that cluster. This panel shows a summary of the resources for the selected cluster. Each field shows the average current consumption of the resource, compared to its allocated capacity. This chart shows the current VMs per host, and also shows the desired count of VMs, assuming you want to fill the headroom completely. Note that the Desired plot shows the result of running a plan. This can include moving your current VMs to different hosts, but the plan always respects the cluster — it never moves VMs to hosts on different clusters. This chart shows the total number of VMs currently running in the cluster, plus the total headroom for the cluster.

Creating_and_Editing_Templates.xml	]> Creating and Editing Templates To deploy VMs, you select a VM Template to specify desired resources for the VM, and a Deployment Profile to specify deployment details such as the source VM package (the OVF or VHD files) and optional placement constraints. &Product_Short; creates a number of VM Templates automatically as it discovers source VM data on the target hypervisors. These templates are read-only; you cannot edit them because they reflect data that is specified in target hypervisor. &Product_Short; also discovers associated Deployment Profiles that correspond with the discovered templates (also read-only). You can create your own VM Templates and Deployment Profiles, and use them to deploy VMs. In this way, you can plan for and deploy VMs with different configurations than any VMs currently defined in your environment. &Product_Short; users can edit these templates if they have privileges to use the &Tab_Deploy; view. This following sections describe: Creating VM Templates Creating Deployment Profiles Discovered Deployment Data Creating VM Templates VM Templates describe the resource allocation that you want to provide for a class of VMs. When deploying VMs, &Product_Short; uses the values that are specified in a chosen VM template. Before creating the template, you should plan allocation of the following resources: VCPUs The virtual CPUs assigned to the VM. Virtual Memory The memory size for the VM, in MB. Note that you should never allocate less than is required for the guest OS. Storage The amount of disk storage assigned to the VM, in GB. Network Throughput Used The amount of the host’s network throughput to assign to the VM, in MB/s. IOPs The input operations per second allocated to the VM. IO Throughput Used The amount of the throughput on the host’s IO bus to assign to the VM, in MB/s. The values you set for these resources determine the configuration of any VMs you deploy using this template. To create a VM Template: Click the Create/Edit icon ( ) to open the dialog box. In the dialog box, click the Add icon for the VM Templates list. To edit an existing template, select the template and click the Edit icon. Note that you can only edit user-created templates. In the fields that appear, enter settings for the VM Template. The Template Name and Vendor fields help identify the template for future use. Click Apply when you’re done. Creating Deployment Profiles A Deployment Profile specifies the physical files that will be copied to deploy the VM, as well as optional placement limitations. In many cases it’s best to simply let &Product_Short; choose where to place the VMs you deploy. However, if you want to limit deployment to a specific datacenter or cluster, you can use a Deployment Profile to specify these constraints. If you are creating a profile for VMs in a Hyper-V environment, you should always select a Hyper-V datacenter or cluster for the profile. Before creating the profile, you should know: The path to the VM package files (OVF or VHD) that will be copied to create the VM Optionally, the name of the datacenter or cluster that you want to deploy the VMs to To create a Deployment Profile: Click the Create/Edit icon ( ) to open the dialog box. In the dialog box, click the Add icon for the Deployment Profiles list. In the fields that appear, provide the settings for the Deployment Profile. Click Apply when you’re done. Discovered Deployment Data Many hypervisor technologies support the use of source VMs as files that can be cloned, and the clones can be deployed as running VMs. For example, XenServer and CloudStack require the use of such source VMs to deploy new running VMs in their environments. When it performs discovery, &Product_Short; identifies the source VM data on each hypervisor, and builds a corresponding set of VM Templates and Deployment Profiles. Hyper-V targets do not include discovered VM Templates and Deployment Profiles. You must create these files to deploy VMs in a Hyper-V environment. In the Deployment Profile, you must specify a Hyper-V datacenter. For discovered VM Templates and Deployment Profiles, &Product_Short; uses the following naming conventions: VM Template — These names begin with the IP address of the hypervisor that stores them Deployment Profile — These names begin with the characters DEP- for “Deployment”, and if they match a discovered template, the profile name mirrors the template’s name To view the settings for a discovered template or profile, open the template editor and select the item you want to inspect. The editor shows the template or profile in a dimmed view. You cannot edit a discovered VM Template or Deployment Profile. This is to preserve the integrity of the template and profile in relation to the source VM data.

When you create a new template or edit a template, the Modify Load dialog box expands to display the template settings. The settings you can make are different, depending on the type of item the template is for. Template Settings for VMs These settings identify a VM type, and specify the resources that VM type will consume. For VCPU, &Product_Short; assigns 75% of the physical CPU resources to the VM. For example, if you specify 1 VCPU for this VM type, &Product_Short; assigns 75% capacity of a CPU on the machine that hosts the VM. This ensures that the host machine has CPU capacity to perform infrastructure tasks. For VMEM and VStorage, &Product_Short; assigns 100% of the physical resources that you specify here. Template Settings for PMs These settings identify a PM type, and specify the resources it can provide. The &_Plan; uses the Price entry to calculate costs or savings when adding or removing host machines.

Defining_Replace_Parameters.xml	]> Defining Replace Parameters To plan hardware replacement, you must specify which hardware you will replace, and what you will replace it with. When you create the plan scenario, you can make the same settings that you make for any other plan. For example, you can set the baseline to past conditions, or you can add more VMs to the workload. For more information, see Creating Plans . The following sections describe settings you make that are special for hardware replacement: Scope (You set scope for any plan, but the effect is slightly different for hardware replacement.) Hardware Type Template Hardware to be Replaced Scope Plan scope determines which devices in the environment will be affected by the plan. For example, if you set the scope to a cluster, then replacement planning will only affect the physical devices in that cluster. Note that you can set the scope to groups of VMs or to Virtual Data Centers. In this case, hardware replacement will affect only the physical machines that provide resources to these virtual entities. To set the current plan’s scope, click the Scope icon ( ). This opens the Define User Scope dialog box where you can navigate the inventory tree and set the plan scope. For more information, see Setting Plan Scope . Hardware Type Hardware Replace plans support Hosts and Data Stores. The type you choose determines which templates you can select, and which hardware you can replace. One plan scenario can be devoted to replacing hosts or storage, or you can define a single scenario that replaces both hosts and data stores. Template The template you choose describes the new hardware for your plan. &Product_Short; ships with predefined templates, and you can create your own templates to describe specific hardware that you have in mind. To create a new template, select Add New Template , and then click Edit Template . Note that as you define your own templates, they are stored with &Product_Short; installation, and are available to anybody else who uses the planner on the same installation. The templates you use here are also available when specifying workloads for a planning scenario. For more information, see Creating Templates . You can make the following settings in a template: User Information Template Name Vendor Description Price: &Product_Short; uses this price to calculate replacement costs or savings Capacity Data: Values &Product_Short; uses to calculate capacity and utilization CPU Cores and Speed Memory Network Throughput IO Throughput When you run a plan, &Product_Short; uses the template’s pricing and capacity data to calculate the plan results. For example, if you replace your current hosts with less powerful models to address under utilization, &Product_Short; will use the template to recalculate the optimal workload distribution. You might see that workload is more evenly distributed across the smaller machines, giving you a saving in actual cost. Hardware to be Replaced Once you have specified the plan scope, hardware type, and the template you want for the scenario, you can specify which hardware you will target for replacement. You can specify individual devices, or you can select groups of devices to replace. When you expand items in this dialog box, the physical devices you can select are limited by the scope you have set for this scenario. For example, assume you selected a cluster of VMs that are restricted to PMs in Cluster-1. In that case, then you browse for hosts to replace, you will only see the hosts in that cluster. After you select the hardware to replace, &Product_Short; commits your parameters to the current scenario. The Plan Modification Log shows the replace actions you have specified for this scenario. Once you have made settings for Host, you can then add in settings to replace data stores as well. After you have made the settings you want, you can then run the plan, save it, or start a new plan to discard your changes.

Any other users logged into the same &Product_Short; instance will receive an error if they try to deploy VMs while these processes are under way. To deploy VMs, you will perform the following steps: Provide a name for the VM or VMs. Provide a descriptive name so you can easily find these VMs in the inventory. Choose the VM Template to use for the new VMs. VM Templates specify the resources available to the VM, including: VCPUs Virtual Memory Storage Network Throughput IOPs IO Throughput Choose the VM Template that specifies the resource allocation that you want for the VM. To inspect VM Templates, open the Edit Templates dialog box ( ), and select the template you’re interested in. (For more information about using this dialog box, see Creating VM Templates .) Note that if the VM Template was discovered, its name begins with the IP address of the hypervisor that manages that VM template data. Also, a discovered template is read-only (you cannot edit discovered templates). When you choose a VM Template, the Deployment Profiles list becomes active. Specify how many VMs to deploy with this action. When you deploy more than one VM, &Product_Short; appends a number to the VM name you provide (MyVM_0, MyVM_1, MyVM_2, etc.). Choose the Deployment Profile to use as the basis of your new VMs. The Deployment Profile specifies physical details about how to deploy the VM, including: The path to the VM package files (OVF or VHD) that will be copied to deploy this VM. Note that if the Deployment Profile data was discovered by &Product_Short;, then the profile does not show a path to the VM package files. Optional placement constraints (constrain to datacenter or cluster) If the Deployment Profile does not specify a datacenter or cluster, then &Product_Short; is free to deploy the VM anywhere in your virtual environment. To inspect Deployment Profiles, open the Edit Templates dialog box, and select the template you’re interested in. (For more information about using this dialog box, see Creating Deployment Profiles .) Note that if the Deployment Profile was discovered, its name begins with the characters DEP- for “Deployment”. A discovered profile is read-only (you cannot edit discovered Deployment Profiles). Begin the deployment action — &Product_Short; displays details for the VMs it will deploy. After you have made your choices, click Begin Deploy . &Product_Short; starts to calculate the optimal placement for the VMs you have decided to deploy. &Product_Short; does not deploy the VMs at this step. After it finishes the calculations, &Product_Short; displays a list of proposed VM deployments, one for each VM that you specified. You may have to wait briefly while &Product_Short; makes these calculations. Review the proposed deployment, and commit the action. Be sure to review the deployment details list, and make sure you want to deploy these VMs. If you do not, you can cancel the operation now, before &Product_Short; makes any changes to your environment. If you agree with the proposed VM deployment, click Commit to create the VMs. You may have to wait a few minutes while &Product_Short; performs the deployment actions.

DiskArray.xml	DiskArray.xml	158545	8	2511	A Disk Array is a data storage system made up of...	Monitored Resources	]> Disk Arrays A Disk Array is a data storage system made up of multiple disk drives. For example, a RAID is a disk array that implements redundancy and other data management features. A disk array provides storage volumes to serve the storage requirements of physical machines. A disk array uses the resources of one storage controller, which manages the disk array operation. &Product_Short; supports disk arrays when you have installed the Storage Extension license. In the inventory tree, the disk arrays are grouped by the storage controller that manages them. For example, the above figure shows three disk arrays managed by one storage controller. Synopsis Budget: A disk array gains its budget by selling resources to the datastores it serves. If utilization of a disk array is high enough, &Product_Short; can recommend that you provision a new one. Provides: Storage resources for datastores to use: Storage amount Storage Provisioned IOPs (storage access operations per second) Latency (capacity for disk latency in ms) Consumes: Storage controllers Discovered through: &Product_Short; discovers disk arrays through storage controller targets (see Adding and Removing Target Virtual Management Servers ). &fmv18; monitors the following resources for a disk array: Storage The percentage utilization of the storage allocated for the given disk array. This is a sum of the aggregated physical storage that the array exposes to the environment. Storage Provisioned The percentage utilization of the storage that was provisioned for this disk array. This encompasses over-provisioning of storage, as well as thin-provisioning on the VMs, deduplication, compression, and other storage optimizations. For example, assume storage over-provisioning of 200% as the only storage optimization, and the current Storage utilization is at 50%. In this case, Storage Provisioned would show a value of 25%. IOPS - Storage Access Operations per Second The percentage utilization of allocated IOPS. The disk array aggregates this value for all its volumes. In other words, all volumes on a given disk array show the same value for this resource. Latency The percentage utilization of allocated latency. The disk array aggregates this value for all its volumes. In other words, all volumes on a given disk array show the same value for this resource. &fmv19; recommends the following actions for a disk array: Provision Disk Array For high utilization of the disk array’s storage, provision a new disk array. Start Disk Array For high utilization of disk array, start a suspended disk array. Suspend Disk Array For low utilization of the disk array’s storage, move VMs to datastores and suspend volumes on the disk array. Move VM For high utilization of a Storage on a volume, &fmv20; can move a VM to another volume. The new volume can be on the current disk array, or on any other datastore. For high IOPS or Latency, a move is always from the current array to another disk array or other datastore. This is because all the volumes on a given disk array show the same IOPS and Latency.

Critical Over-Utilization Whenever any system resource reaches critical utilization, your infrastructure can experience bottlenecks. Applications running on VMs that are hosted by critically over-utilized machines will show performance problems, and so your QoS may suffer. The resources that can be affected are: Memory CPU IO Network utilization CPU Ready Queues Data storage Possible Resolutions: Move VMs from the affected host to a host with less utilization. &Product_Short; can perform this action automatically. Start or provision a new host machine. You must perform this action manually. Provision a new data store. You must perform this action manually. Low Utilization Under-utilization presents an opportunity to increase efficiency, because it results in higher costs to maintain excessive hardware. The resources that can be affected are: Memory CPU IO Network utilization CPU Ready Queues Possible Resolutions: Move VMs from an under-utilized host to another host. &Product_Short; can perform this action automatically. Suspend the under-utilized host. &Product_Short; can perform this action automatically. Mis-configured VMs Bottlenecks can arise when a VM is not configured with enough virtual processing power to support its applications. The resources that can be affected are: Number of VCPUs in a virtual machine Possible Resolutions: Reconfigure the affected VM. You must perform this action manually. Mis-configured Infrastructure &Product_Short; can identify general configuration problems in your infrastructure. These problems can result in poor QOS, even though none of the hosts show over-utilization problems. The resources that can be affected are configuration of: Network Cluster Storage Possible Resolutions: Reconfigure the affected infrastructure resource. You must perform these actions manually.

You can toggle the panel between a To Do list and a list of current efficiency opportunities. (For a complete description of To Do panels, see To Do Lists - Maintaining QoS .) Virtual Machine and Storage This panel lists clusters of VMs that you can inspect to see how they consume storage resources. When you expand a VM cluster, the panel shows how many VMs are in the cluster, and how much storage is devoted to them. The panel also shows how many VMs are dormant (no application is active on the VM) and how many are powered off. In this way, you can see how much storage is held in reservation for unused VMs. Wasted Storage The Wasted Storage panel lists datastore clusters, showing the amount of wasted storage for each. In &Product_Short;, wasted storage is any disk space devoted to files that are not required for operations of the devices or applications in your environment. For datastores that you have set aside to support VMs, wasted storage may indicate opportunities for you to free up disk space, and provide more disk capacity to running VMs and applications. You can specify directories that &Product_Short; will not consider when calculating wasted storage. For more information, see Storage Settings . Virtual Machine Efficiency This panel lists VM clusters, showing how they consume their available memory and CPU resources. Expand the cluster and the Memory or CPU resource to see the values. For each resource type, the table shows the following amounts. These values show the total amount of the resource that is devoted to the indicated number of VMs. Current Amount — How much of the resource is currently devoted to the indicated VMs Target Amount — If &Product_Short; sees an opportunity to improve efficiency by reducing resource allocation, the amount that should be devoted to the indicated VMs Change — The amount of resource savings you would see by executing the change The table shows three rows for each resource type: Reservation — The amount of the resource that is reserved for the indicated VMs; before starting up a VM, the host must be able to provide the reserved amount Limit — The limit for that resource as set on the indicated VMs Capacity — The amount of the resource that the indicated VMs can utilize; capacity is a property of the VM, and indicates how much of the resource that VM is able to use For example, assume the above illustration. For the expanded cluster, you can say: 11 VMs consume memory For those VMs, the reserved memory totals 9,019,392 KB None of the VMs have limits to memory consumption. However, two of the VMs have limits such that the both of them cannot consume more than 4,800 MHz of CPU resources The 11 VMs have an aggregate memory capacity of 14,925,824 KB Six of the VMs have reserved a total of 3,300 MHz CPU processing The 11 VMs consume a total of 55,800 MHz CPU processing The 11 VMs consume 640,494 MB of storage space You can click a VM Cluster item to display details, including a To Do list and resource consumption of each VM in the cluster.

Increasing_Virtual_Load_under_Existing_Constraints.xml	]> Increasing Virtual Load under Existing Constraints Assume you want to determine the load distribution if you add more VMs to your environment. To do this, you would create a Workload Distribution scenario that adds the new VMs, and then determines the best way to spread the increased load among your physical hosts and data stores. Your environment already has its physical systems assigned to clusters and resource pools. As you add VMs to the environment, you want to respect these constraints. When thinking about this scenario, imagine asking, “What would happen if I add ten VMs running Web servers, and ten VMs running database servers? How can I optimally deploy these VMs in my current environment?” To plan out the best way to add these VMs to your inventory, you create a Workload Distribution scenario that: Identifies how many VMs to add Uses an existing Web server VM as a model for your new Web server VMs Uses an existing database VM as a model for your new database VMs The following steps show how to create such a scenario in the Plan view: Display the Workload Distribution tab in the &_Plan;. Choose New from the Plan popup menu. This clears the &_Plan; so you can specify a new plan. Edit the load for your plan. For this plan you will add 20 VMs to your environment. Click the Load icon ( ) to open the Edit Load dialog box Specify the properties of the VMs that you will add For this scenario, you will add copies of existing VMs to your load. Copying existing VMs is just one way to specify the properties of your new VMs. To add copies of a specific VM, expand the VM group and select the VM you want, then click ADD . In the following image, the dialog box is set up to add 10 copies of a VM named Fedora 1: Now select another VM to copy, and add 10 more VMs to your load Be sure to click ADD after you have selected the new VM to copy. Now that you have defined the new load, click Close and Run . Alternatively, you can just click Close and make other settings before running the planner scenario. For example, to plan for a recurring peak load you can run the scenario against a load that occurred in the past. Or you can specify the scope of the scenario so that it will only run on a specific group of physical hosts. After making these other changes, you would then click Run to execute the plan.

Infrastructure_Cost.xml	]> Infrastructure Cost Often you will have different classes of hardware to host your environment, where you wish to reserve more expensive hardware for critical use. For example, you might reserve more expensive hosts to run business-critical applications, and reserve lower-cost hardware for your development environment. In that case, you would want &Product_Short; to place applications accordingly — critical applications on these higher-priced hosts, and development applications on the lower-cost machines. Assigning a Host Template to the Infrastructure Cost Policy With Infrastructure Cost policies, you create templates that approximate your different classes of machines, and then assign those templates to the policies. &Product_Short; then discovers which machines best match these templates, and assigns the machines to associated groups. For example, if you create a Small, a Medium, and a Large host template, &Product_Short; creates three groups — PMs_Small, PMs_Medium, and PMs_Large. It then assigns all the hosts in your environment to these groups, according to which template most closely describes each host. When you assign a template to an Infrastructure Cost policy, you can check which machines in your environment match the template settings. This shows you which machines would be in the group for that template. Creating an Infrastructure Cost Policy To create an Infrastructure Cost policy: Choose the device type you want — Host or Storage. Choose the templates you want to add to the policy. You can choose an existing template from the template catalog, or create a new one. Edit the template. Specify the following: Template name and description Price — You should specify a price that approximates your hardware cost as well as possible. Currently, this price displays in generated reports. In future versions of &Product_Short; the price might be used for other calculations. Capacity — Do your best to approximate the capacity for the class of hardware you’re describing. &Product_Short; uses these values to decide which group to put each device into. If a machine doesn’t exactly match any templates in the policy, &Product_Short; assigns the machine to the closest match possible. Add to Infrastructure Cost Policy — Turn on this check box to add the template to the policy. For each template that you enable, &Product_Short; creates an associated group. ( Note: If no machines match the given template, then the group will not appear in the GUI.) Apply the changes. Click Apply to assign the template to the policy. Using the Infrastructure Cost Policy These policies assign hardware to groups. The groups appear in the By Cost folder. When you set scope to a dashboard or a Workload Placement policy, you can select these or other groups. Setting Scope to a Group by Cost You can use these groups with the following &Product_Short; features: Dashboards in The Home View You can use Infrastructure Cost groups to set the scope of dashboards on the &Tab_Home; view. In this way, you can save custom dashboards that only show information about a specific class of hardware. For more information, see Viewing Standard Dashboards . Workload Placement With Workload Placement policies, you can ensure that certain VMs will always be placed on hardware of a certain class, or else you can specify that certain VMs never get placed on a class of hardware.

Introducing_Operations_Manager.xml	]> Introducing &Product_Short; Thank you for choosing &Product;, the premier solution for intelligent workload management of cloud and virtual environments. &Product_Short; maintains your environment within the optimal operating zone —operating conditions that achieve the following conflicting goals at the same time: Assured application performance Prevent bottlenecks, provision physical resources, upsize VMs, prioritize workload. Efficient use of resources Consolidate workload, downsize VMs, prevent VM sprawl and dormant VMs. Keeping a virtual infrastructure within the optimal zone is not a simple problem. You have to consider many different resources, numerous control points for each device, and how devices and resources are used in relation to each other. As you add devices to your infrastructure, the factors for each decision increase exponentially. On top of that, the environment is constantly changing—to stay in the optimal zone, you are constantly trying to hit a moving target. To perform intelligent workload management, &Product_Short; models the environment as a market made up of buyers and sellers . These buyers and sellers make up a supply chain that represents tiers of devices in your inventory. &Product_Short; uses Virtual Currency to give a budget to buyers and assign cost to resources. This virtual currency assigns value across all tiers of your environment, making it possible to compare the cost of application transactions with the cost of space on a disk or physical space in a data center. The price that a seller charges for a resource changes according to the seller’s supply. As demand increases, prices increase. As prices increase, buyers and sellers react. Buyers are free to look for other sellers that offer a better price, and sellers can duplicate themselves (open new storefronts) to meet increasing demand. &Product_Short; uses its Economic Scheduling Engine to analyze the market and make these decisions. The effect is an invisible hand that dynamically guides your IT infrastructure to the optimal use of resources. To get the most out of &Product_Short;, you should understand how it models your environment, the kind of analysis it performs, and the optimal state it works to achieve. This section describes the following in more detail: The Optimal Operating Zone The Market and Virtual Currency The Economic Scheduling Engine The Operations Manager Supply Chain Operations Manager Actions Supply Chain Terminology Resource Descriptions

The following table shows the default settings for hardware cost: Attribute Default Value Host Hardware Cost 9000 Cost of CPU per unit 200 Cost of memory per GB 50 Cost of storage per TB 50 Heatmap Critical Utilization &Product_Short; compares utilization metrics in your environment to the operational constraints you specify (see Utilization Constraints and Storage Settings ). It uses that comparison to set colored notifications in heatmaps, trigger problem notifications, and to classify the problems it finds. The values you set here define what &Product_Short; considers critical violations for different metrics. For example, assume you define critical as 80% for a metric. Based on the settings you make for the monitored metrics, &Product_Short; then classifies these metrics as follows: If the value is: The classification is: More than 80% of the constraint setting Critically overutilized More than 60% and less than 80% of setting Overutilized For under utilization, assume you define critical as 10% for a metric. Based on the settings you make for the monitored metrics, &Product_Short; then classifies these metrics as follows: If the value is: The classification is: Less than 10% and more than 5% of setting Under utilized Less than 5% of analysis setting Critically under utilized The following table shows the default settings for critical utilization: Attribute Default Value Critical Utilization Percent for IOPS 80 Critical Utilization Percent for CPU 80 Critical Utilization Percent for Memory 80 Critical Utilization Percent for IO Throughput 80 Critical Utilization Percent for Net Throughput 80 Critical Utilization Percent for Swapping 80 Critical Utilization Percent for Latency 80 Critical Utilization Percent for Storage Amount 80 Reporting Upper and Lower Bounds The following table shows the default settings for operational constraints on virtual machines. Upper bounds limit the amount of a physical resource that will be devoted to a VM consumer. For example, with a VMem upper bound of 85 &Product_Short; will never devote more than 85% of physical memory to VMs running on a host. This ensures the host machine has enough physical memory to perform core operations. Lower bounds identify the percentage utilization that &Product_Short; will consider under utilized. For example, with a VMem lower bound of 10, if utilization falls below 10% &Product_Short; will consider migrating consumers to another host and suspending the under utilized physical machine. Attribute Default Value VMem Utilization Upper Bound 85 VCPU Utilization Upper Bound 85 VMem Utilization Lower Bound 10 VCPU Utilization Lower Bound 10 VStorage Utilization Upper Bound 85 VStorage Utilization Lower Bound 10 Resize Recommendation Settings When &Product_Short; recommends changes to virtual resources, it uses increments as it calculates how much to raise or lower the given value, and a Rate of Resize to specify how many increments to apply in a single resize action. For CloudStack environments, resize is determined by templates. Resize Increments have no effect. However, Rate of Resize can affect which template &Product_Short; will use for a resize operation. Assume an environment with small , medium , and large templates, and a VM that is set to small needs to be resized to large . If the Rate of Resize is set to Low, &Product_Short; might try the medium template first. However, if the setting is High, then &Product_Short; will probably use the large template for the initial resize operation. Resize Increments The increments specify how many units to add or subtract when resizing the given resource allocation for a VM. For example, it makes sense to change VMEM by steps of 1024 MB at a time, but for VStorage it’s better to make changes by 0.5 GB steps. The following table shows the default settings for the Resize increments: Attribute Default Value Increment constant for VMem of Virtual Machine [MB] 1024 Increment constant for VCPU of Virtual Machine [MHz] 1800 Increment constant for VStorage of Virtual Machine [GB] 100000 Increment constant for Storage Amount of Volumes and Aggregates [GB] 100 For VMem, you should not set the increment value below 1024. Virtual machines rely on VMem to start up and run. For a VM that is under utilized, &Product_Short; will reduce VMem allocation by the increment amount, but it will not leave a VM with zero VMem. For example, if you set this to 512, then &Product_Short; could reduce the memory for a VM to 512 Kb. It’s possible that If the increment is too low, then &Product_Short; might allocate insufficient VMem for the machine to operate. Rate of Resize When resizing resources for a VM, &Product_Short; calculates the optimal values for VMEM, VCPU and VStorage. But it does not necessarily make a change to that value in one action. &Product_Short; uses the Rate of Resize setting to determine how to make the change in a single action, as follows: Low Change the value by one increment, only. For example, if the resize action calls for increasing VMEM, and the increment is set at 1024, &Product_Short; increases VMEM by 1024 MB. Medium Change the value to be halfway between the current value, and the optimal value. For example, if the current VMEM is 2 GB and the optimal VMEM is 8 GB, then &Product_Short; will raise VMEM to 5 GB (or as close to that as the increment constant will allow). High Change the value to be the optimal value. For example, if the current VMEM is 2 GB and the optimal VMEM is 8 GB, then &Product_Short; will raise VMEM to 8 GB (or as close to that as the increment constant will allow). The default setting for Rate of Resize is Medium . Utilization Constraints &Product_Short; uses the constraints you set for specific metrics when it analyzes your environment and recommends changes that will achieve the optimal targets. The following table shows the default settings for operational constraints on physical machines. Attribute Default Value Storage Amount Utilization 100 Storage IOPS Utilization 100 Host CPU Utilization 100 Host Memory Utilization 100 Host IO Throughput 20 Host Net Throughput 20 Switch Net Throughput 70 Network Net Throughput 100 Host Swapping Utilization 20 Storage Latency Utilization 100 CPU Overprovisioned Percentage 1000 Mem Overprovisioned Percentage 1000 Advanced The advanced settings adjust the overall analysis performed by the economic scheduling engine. They adjust how &Product_Short; calculates recommended actions, as well as the desired state &Product_Short; will try to achieve for your environment. Price Price settings affect how the Economic Scheduling Engine assigns a virtual price when recommending actions. The Time Range Constant sets the number of days-worth of historical data &Product_Short; will use when making recommendations to decrease the resources available to a VM or application. &Product_Short; makes suggestions to reduce resources on a daily basis. (Note that &Product_Short; can make recommendations to increase resources every 10-minute cycle. For these recommendations it looks back 24 hours.) Weights for peaks and averages specify the degree to which historic peak and average metric values will affect calculations. These settings are a way to attenuate the Economic Scheduling Engine’s response to events in the environment. A higher weight for historic peaks or averages reduces the impact of current peaks or averages. For example, assume you have applications that use 100% CPU for short transient events. To reduce the impact of these transients, you can set a higher value for Weight for Peaks . As a result, &Product_Short; only responds to longer-lasting events of 100% CPU utilization. The following table shows the default settings for overall &Product_Short; settings. Attribute Default Value Time Range Constant 100 Weight for Peaks 99 Weight for Averages 50 Desired State The desired state for your environment is an n-dimensional sphere that encompasses the fittest conditions your environment can achieve. The multiple dimensions of this sphere are defined by the resource metrics in your environment. Metric dimensions include VMem, storage, CPU, etc. While the metrics on the devices in your environment can be any value, the desired state, this n-dimensional sphere, is the subset of metric values that assures the best performance while achieving the most efficient utilization of resources that is possible. The Desired State settings define the center of the sphere as well as its diameter. This is a way for you to customize what &Product_Short; considers to be the desired state. Setting the center of the sphere chooses the priority for &Product_Short; analysis. If you set the balance in favor of efficiency, &Product_Short; tends to place more VMs on fewer physical hosts, and to give storage capacity from fewer data stores. As a result, high utilization can have more impact on QoS. With a balance in favor of performance, &Product_Short; tends to spread virtual loads across more physical devices. This can result in the provisioning of excess resources. The diameter setting determines the range of deviation from the center that can encompass the desired state. If you specify a large diameter, &Product_Short; will have more variation in the way it distributes workload across hosting devices. As you move each slider, a tooltip displays the numerical value of the setting. Center indicates the percentage of resource utilization you want, within the range you specify as Diameter . For example, if you want utilization of 75%, plus or minus 10%, then you would set Center = 75 and Diameter = 20. &Product_Short; recommends actions that tend toward this desired state much as possible, given the dependencies within the current environment. The setting for Target Utilization can have an effect on plans that you run. If you disable provisioning and suspension for hosts and datastores, then you should always set Center and Diameter to their default values. (For more information about hardware provisioning in plans, see Hardware Management .) The following table shows the default settings for Desired State: Attribute Default Value Center 70 Diameter 10

Provision	]> &Product_Short; Actions &Product_Short; does more than track problems in your environment. Before problems occur, &Product_Short; identifies actions you can take to avoid the problems. You can perform these actions manually, direct &Product_Short; to perform the actions on command, or direct &Product_Short; to perform actions automatically as they arise. You can set different action modes (whether to automate or not) for individual actions (see Action Modes ). To recommend and perform actions, the &Product_Short; Economic Scheduling Engine treats your environment as a market with providers and consumers. Entities in the market interact in provider/consumer relationships. For example, a PM hosts a VM — The PM provides compute resources, physical memory, and network throughput to the VM, and the VM consumes these resources. &Product_Short; performs four general types of actions: Provision — Adding resource capacity, usually by adding an entity Decommission — Stopping, suspending, or removing an entity Move — Placing a consumer on a different host Resize — Changing the allocation of resources on an entity Provisioning actions add capacity to your environment. For example, provisioning a PM adds more compute capacity that is available to host VMs. Provisioning a VM adds capacity to run applications. &Product_Short; can provision the following: VMs PMs Storage Disk Arrays In practice, provisioning for a Storage Controller only occurs in planning scenarios. In your environment, you would manually add disk arrays to storage controllers , and would not be able to add an array if there was not a storage controller present to host it. Decommissioning actions either terminate entities (remove them fro the environment) or suspend them (set resources aside without removing them from the environment). Suspended capacity is still available, but is currently not in use. Suspended resources are candidates for removal. &Product_Short; can decommission the following: VMs PMs Storage Disk Arrays Moves are actions that change a consumer to use a different provider. For example, moving a VM assigns the VM to be hosted on a different PM. Moving a VM’s storage means the VM will use a different datastore. &Product_Short; can move the following: VMs Storage Resize actions allocate more or fewer resources on an entity. Typical resizing includes adding or subtracting VCPUs or VMem on a VM, adding or subtracting capacity on a datastore, and adding or subtracting volumes in a disk array. &Product_Short; can resize the following: VMs Storage Disk Arrays (for example, start an additional drive in the array) The following table summarizes the actions &Product_Short; can perform or recommend for the inventory items in the supply chain: Inventory Item Provision Decommission Move Resize Virtual Application N/A Application signatures identify which applications are bound to specific load balancers. As &Product_Short; provisions or decommissions VMs running these applications, those actions increase or decrease the capacity of a virtual application. In this way, Operations Manager adds or subtracts capacity on a load balancer For information about load balancer targets, see Load Balancer Discovery .

Physical_Machines.xml	Physical_Machines.xml	158559	8	2702	A physical machine (PM or Host) is a server that runs...	Monitored Resources	]> Physical Machines A physical machine (PM or Host) is a server that runs a hypervisor process. This means the PM can host VMs that are managed by the given hypervisor. Note that a PM is not necessarily a physical box, or computing iron. A VM can be set up as a server that runs a hypervisor, and it can in turn host other VMs within its processing space. However, it’s most usual to use iron as your PMs. Synopsis Budget: A PM gains its budget by selling resources to the VMs it hosts. The more VMs running on a PM, the more budget the PM has to purchase storage and datacenter resources. If utilization of a PM is high enough, &Product_Short; can recommend that you provision a new PM. If utilization falls off, the PM loses budget. Ultimately, if the budget isn’t enough to pay for the services it consumes, &Product_Short; will suspend or power off the PM. Provides: Host resources for VMs to use: Mem (Kbytes) CPU (MHz) IO (throughput on the I/O bus) Net (network throughput) Swap (swap rate capacity measured in bytes/sec) Ballooning (sharing of memory among hosted VMs) CPU Ready Queue (wait time on the queue in ms) Consumes: Datacenter resources (physical space, cooling, etc.) and storage.

By default, when you run a plan &Product_Short; can provision or suspend hosts and storage within that plan. This means that if &Product_Short; sees that you would get better results by adding or removing hardware, the plan will recommend that you perform those actions, and the plan will reflect the results you would get by performing those actions. There are reasons to run a plan with hardware provisioning and suspension disabled. For example, you might want to use the planner to see how much workload you can add to your current environment. To do that you would: Add workload to the environment Disable provisioning for hosts and storage Run the plan and review the results This is not simply looking at how much more workload you can place on specific hosts. The plan will redistribute the workload to get the best possible results. After running the plan you may find that you can add more workload than you initially thought — without adding any new hardware. &Product_Short; includes settings to specify the desired state in your environment. It is unusual to change these settings, but if you have changed them from the defaults, you should not disable hardware provisioning or suspension.

Scope can be either: Global Settings : Base settings for each category that apply by default to all resources Group Overrides : Settings you apply to specific groups of resources Global Settings To make global settings, select a category, and if necessary select a resource type. The following image shows global settings for actions on Hosts. Global Policy Settings These are the base settings for all the resources in your inventory. The settings you make on groups and individual resources will override these global settings. Group Overrides You can make settings to groups of resources that override the global settings for the resource type. (For information about defining custom groups, see Group Management .) As you make these settings, you should be aware of issues that can arise with: Conflicting Settings Top-level Groups Conflicting Settings You can set overrides on any groups listed in the Profiles view. However, it’s possible that individual machines or applications are in more than one group (see the following illustration). Same VM in Two Groups In this case, you could set different overrides for the two groups, which can then conflict with each other in the same resource instance. For example, assume the following settings for VM Resizing : The Global setting is Manual The override for VMs_Beta\Cluster-1 (in Virtual Machines by Cluster) is Automated The override for VMs_dv VM Network (in Virtual Machines by Network) is Recommend In this case, two different settings will be associated with the VM named Fedora 12. In all such conflicts, &Product_Short; uses a tie-breaker to resolves the conflict. In the case of actions, the tie-breaker uses the most conservative setting. Following this example, any Resize actions for Fedora 12 will be of type Recommend , because that is the most conservative of the settings for this VM. The documentation for each policy category describes the tie-breaker for that category. Tie-breakers only apply among override settings. For example, even if a global action setting is more conservative than its override, the override takes precedence. But among two or more overrides for the same setting, the tie-breaker comes into effect. You can navigate to any instance in the scope tree, see its effective setting, and also see where that has been set. For example, the following figure shows that the action mode for Resize on Fedora 12 is Recommend , and it was set in the VMs_dv VM Network group. Viewing the Effective Setting for a VM Top-level Groups Within each policy category, the editor displays resources in groups. The following figure shows groups for actions on VMs. Top-level Groups for Actions Notice that each category has top-level groups. For example, the Action category sets policies for actions on VMs, hosts, datastores, and virtual datacenters. For VM actions the scope tree shows: Virtual Machines Virtual Machines by Cluster Virtual Machines by Network Virtual Machines by Storage Each of these is a top-level group. Beneath each top level you can see the individual groups that contain the resources. It’s likely that most individual resources belong to all of the top-level groups. For example, it’s likely that a single VM belongs to Virtual Machines by Cluster and to Virtual Machines by Datacenter You should not make settings to the top-level groups. You could make a top-level setting that always wins a tie-breaker, and so all the lower-level settings would never take effect. If you set overrides to a top-level group after lower-level settings were already made, you could inadvertently make all the lower-level settings ineffective. If you want to make settings to all resources (all PMs or all VMs, for example), then you should make global settings (see Global Settings ). You should not make settings in a top-level group.

The dashboard starts from the current state of your environment and: Shows the deployment you would achieve if you accepted the recommended actions in the &Product_Short; To Do list Projects your needs into the future, assuming you maintain system health by continually executing recommended actions Updates its projections daily to respond to changing patterns of workload requirements To make these projections, &Product_Short; adds the projected number of VMs to a hypothetical environment for the given projection period. It then runs Workload Projection planning scenarios for the given clusters on your environment, without taking constraints into account (see Workload Projection ). The dashboard shows a series of projections for: One month Two months Three months Six months Nine months One year When you first install and start up &Product_Short;, it builds up the list of cluster projections daily. By default, it runs a year’s worth of projections for two clusters each day. So if you environment has ten clusters, you will see a full set of cluster projections after five days of operation. The reliability of a projection depends on the amount of historical data it can use to establish a curve and extrapolate. For example, a 12 month projection based on two weeks of data is not as reliable as 12 months based on 90 days of historical data. If the system has not been running long enough to accumulate 60 days of data, &Product_Short; uses the available data to generate projections as follows: With less than 6 days of historical data, the first- and second-month projections will show flat lines. The other projections will be blank. With less than 30 days of historical data, the dashboard calculates the first- and second-month projections. The other projections will be blank. With more than 30 days of historical data, the dashboard calculates projections up to the 12th-month. The projections use historical data to investigate how workload has been added in the past, and projects the anticipated workload in the future. For example: For the first-month projection, it looks at how many VMs were added in the month previous, and are still present in your environment. For example, if you added 6 VMs last month, and one has been removed, then the 1-month projection adds another five VMs. For the second-month projection, &Product_Short; uses two months of history in a similar way. For example, if you added eight VMs two months ago, and five of those are still in your environment, then the projection assumes 10 VMs — five for two months ago, and five for last month. For the third-month projection, the calculations are the same, only using three months of data. For the 6-, 9-and 12-month projections, &Product_Short; uses the three-month calculation, and multiplies it by 2, 3, and 4, respectively. For example, as workload changes and you add more VMs to your environment, the projections assume a similar rate of growth. If growth continues at that rate, the projections show when you will need to add new physical resources to support growing demand. The dashboard displays the following panels: Cluster Summary This panel lists the current state of the VM clusters in your environment. You can use this panel to see details about the current deployment of VMs, hosts, and datastores. You can expand a cluster entry to see the counts for VMs, hosts, and datastores into the future. This release of &Product_Short; does not support the projection of totals for datastores. If you expand the Total item, the Datastores column shows NA for each row. As you select a cluster in this panel, the other dashboard panels update to show data for that cluster. In this way you can see how each cluster will change into the future. To see projection data for the full environment, select the Total item. Cluster Projection Chart This chart shows a projection of total memory and CPU usage, based on the historical performance of your environment. When you select an item in the Cluster Summary panel, this chart updates to show the associated projection data. Provisioning Projections These charts show how your requirements for VMs, hosts, and datastores will change into the future. The green horizontal line indicates the number of devices you have in the environment today. The bars show the projected number of devices you will need into the future, with blue bars for projections within the current capacity, and red bars for projections that exceed the current capacity. Note that while the projections for physical machines and datastores are below current capacity, you can probably save money by consolidating your VMs on fewer physical devices. When projections exceed capacity, the charts indicate when you will need to invest in more hardware resources. In the above example, the dashboard projects that you will not need to add storage in the next year. However, it appears that you will need eight physical machines before the year’s end.

Monitored Resources	]> Provider Virtual Datacenters A provider virtual datacenter (vDC) is a collection of physical resources (PMs and datastores) managed by a cloud stack. The cloud administrator has access to these resources, and defines the datacenter members. Usually a provider vDC is created to manage resources that will be exposed to external customers through one or more organizational vDCs. Synopsis Budget: A Provider vDC gains its budget by selling resources to the Organization vDCs that it hosts. If utilization falls off, the datacenter loses budget. Ultimately, if the budget isn’t enough to pay for the services it consumes, &Product_Short; will terminate the Provider vDC. Provides: Physical resources such as PMs and datastores. Consumes: PMs and datastores Discovered through: &Product_Short; discovers vDCs through cloud stack managers such as vCloud Director (see Adding and Removing Target Virtual Management Servers ). &fmv18; monitors the following resources for a provider virtual datacenter: Mem The percentage of physical machine memory that is reserved or in use, measured in Kbytes. For a virtual datacenter, this is measured against the sum of the memory allocated to the physical machines in the datacenter. Storage The storage allocated to a storage controller is the total of all the physical space available to the storage controller. This includes disks for disk arrays, spare disks, or other physical space the controller manages. In charts, this metric shows the percentage of this storage that is utilized by the charted device. CPU The percentage utilization of CPU resources allocated to the storage controller. &fmv19; does not recommend actions to perform on a virtual datacenter.

Host reporting provides comprehensive customizable reports to track, analyze and trend your physical and virtual infrastructure operations. Storage reporting provides reports to track, analyze and trend the storage resources in your environment. The reporting utility includes a set of already defined reports, and you can design your own custom reports. Standard reports are in PDF format, and you can also export XML versions to view as Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. &Product_Short; generates standard reports every day at a determined time (2:00 am on the &Product_Short; system clock). With these reports you can see historical information about the state of your environment. &Product_Short; must run for at least 24 hours before the it can generate standard reports. You can view these reports in your web browser, or you can send them to a specified e-mail address. You can also add lists of subscribers to each report, including e-mail and reporting interval (daily or weekly). In this way, you can use &Product_Short; reports to keep a specific group of people informed about the state of your environment. When you create custom reports, &Product_Short; generates them per your request. These reports can display five-minute data, hourly data, or data that is consolidated daily. The Reports page displays a customized report as HTML — you can print it or save it as PDF, CSV, or XML. You can also send custom reports to a specified address and set up subscriptions. When you click the Reports tool ( ) or a report icon for an inventory item ( ), &Product_Short; displays the reporting utility in a new web page.

Resource_Descriptions.xml	]> Resource Descriptions To perform intelligent workload balancing, &Product_Short; resource Resource Resource Descriptions collects raw data from its target servers (hypervisors, cloud management stacks, or load balancers). &Product_Short; asynchronously polls its target servers at 10-minute intervals to collect the target's latest data samples. It then uses these 10-minute data points for analysis and to display data in the GUI. The way Operations Manager collects host memory data from vCenter Server illustrates how this works. vCenter Server collects peak metrics from its managed VMs at 20-second intervals. Every ten minutes Operations Manager polls vCenter Server to collect its last round of data samples (30 samples in 10 minutes). To track a VM's utilization of host memory, Operations Manager requests memory.active data samples. From that polling, &Product_Short; can track: Max Memory Utilization - &Product_Short; uses the highest value in each polling sample. This gives the highest percentage of active memory utilization for the selected VM (or group of VMs), plotted over the selected time period. For a max value, &Product_Short; uses the highest observed active memory value in the data sample. Average Memory Utilization - &Product_Short; averages all the values in each polling sample. The following table lists the metrics &Product_Short; collects, and includes details about how they are collected or measured. For charts of clusters or groups of devices, charts show the average of the percentage of allocated resources that are used. Resource: Description: 1- 2- 4-CPU Rdy Wait time in the ready queue on the host, measured in ms. Charts show the percentage allocated ready queue capacity that is in use on the host. For host charts, this is a measure of the total ready queue wait time for all the VMs running on that host. Balloon Ballooning capacity on the host, measured in Kbytes. Ballooning indicates the sharing of memory among the VMs on a given host. Charts show the percentage allocated ballooning capacity that is in use on the host. CPU Host CPU capacity, measured in Mhz. This shows what percentage of CPU cycles are devoted to processing instructions. Host charts show the percentage of the host’s CPU capacity that is in use. VM charts show the percentage of the host’s CPU capacity that is consumed by the given VM. IO Data rate through the host’s IO adapter, measured in Kbytes/sec. Datacenter charts show the average percentage of the host IO capacity that is in use, for all the hosts in the datacenter. Host charts show the percentage of the host’s total IO capacity that is in use. IOPS Storage access operations per second. Charts show the percentage of allocated IOPS capacity that is used on a datastore. Latency Allocated capacity for latency on a datastore. This measures the latency experienced by all VMs and hosts that access the datastore. Charts show the percentage of allocated latency that is in use on the datastore. Mem Host memory, measured in Kbytes. Host charts show the percentage of the host’s memory that is in use. VM charts show the percentage of the host’s memory that is consumed by the given VM. NET Data rate through the host’s Network adapter, measured in Kbytes/sec. Datacenter charts show the average percentage of the host NET capacity that is used for all the hosts in the datacenter. Host charts show the percentage of the host’s total NET capacity that is in use. Storage Datastore capacity, measured in Kbytes. Datastore charts show the percentage of a datastore’s capacity that is in use. Storage Provisioned This resource shows how much the given storage is over-subscribed. Storage Provisioned capacity is the storage capacity multiplied by the Storage Overprovisioned Percentage (200 by default). The higher this value, the greater the risk that storage is over-committed. Swap Allocated swap space on the host. Charts show the percentage of a host’s allocated swap space that is in use. Transactions Transactions per second in an application. Charts show the percentage of an application’s allocated transaction capacity that is in use. UI A measure of the risk to Quality of Service (QoS) that a consumer will experience. The higher the UI on a provider, the more risk to QoS for any consumer of that provider’s services. Charts show the UI for the given device. VCPU Virtual CPU capacity on a VM, measured in Mhz. Charts show the percentage of a VM???s VCPU cycles that are devoted to processing instructions. VMem Virtual memory allocated on a VM, measured in Kbytes. Charts show the percentage of a VM’s allocated VMem that is in use. Note that percentages of allocated VMem are measured against whichever is the less of: The VMem limit (if set) or the allocated VMem capacity. This is also true in reports and recommended actions. For example, assume a VM with allocated VMem of 8 GB, but a limit of 4 GB. In this case, the percentage in a chart shows the percentage utilized of 4GB. VStorage Virtual storage allocated on a VM, measured in Kbytes. Charts show the percentage of a VM’s allocated VStorage that is in use.

Running_Plans.xml	]> Running Plans You can use plans to compare hypothetical conditions against the current conditions of your environment. You can modify a plan by setting conditions such as: Adding or removing VMs Using historical load conditions Respecting or ignoring constraints such as clusters or workload placement policies Adding hardware or restricting the plan to the current inventory By default, a new and untitled plan mirrors your current environment. You can run the &_Plan; against such a scenario, and it will give you results for your current environment. For example, to check the workload distribution of your current environment you simply run a new and untitled plan. The &_Plan; can run scenarios to calculate three types of results: Workload Distribution — The &_Plan; calculates the configuration of your environment that will best distribute the planned load across your devices. You can run the plan with no modifications to distribute the current load on your environment, or you can create a plan that specifies a different load. For more information, see Workload Distribution . Workload Projection — The &_Plan; uses historical resource consumption data to calculate the future consumption you can expect under the plan’s conditions. Run a plan with no modifications to see how your current configuration will hold up into the future. Or you can run a projection with plan conditions that test how the environment would respond in the future to a different load. For more information, see Workload Projection . Hardware Replace — Use templates for hosts or data stores to plan the effects you will see if you change the capacity of the physical devices in your environment. For more information, see Hardware Replace . By default, a plan incorporates all the constraints (cluster, storage, and network) and workload placement policies that are in effect. You can run a plan in two modes with respect to these constraints: Normal mode: The plan incorporates all the constraints. For example, in this mode the plan will not give resources from one cluster to a VM that is constrained to another cluster. Merge mode: The plan disables all the constraints before running. For example, in this mode the plan results can include: Moving VMs to hardware that is in a different cluster Moving VMs to hardware that uses different storage Changes that violate enabled workload placement policies When you run a plan, you can control whether the plan results assume you will add new hosts, or you will support the planned conditions with your current host inventory. Click the Enable Host Provisioning tool to enable or disable the addition of new hosts in your environment. The results of running a plan are incremental — if you run the same plan twice, the summary compares the first plan’s results to the second plan’s results. For example, assume you click Run to run a plan that respects all the constraints in your environment, and it suggests suspending a host — for example, from a current inventory of 15 hosts, to a desired inventory of 14 hosts. The Summary panel will show a bar chart for 15 hosts in your current environment, compared to a desired result with 14 hosts. Then if you click Merge and Run to disable constraints, the Summary panel will show a bar chart for 14 hosts in your current environment, compared to the new desired results. To ensure clean results that are easy to understand, you should not run the same plan successively. Instead, you should load a new plan, or reload a saved plan before clicking Run or Merge and Run . For information about loading plans, see the procedure below, or see Managing Plan Files . To run a plan: Display the plan type you want: Workload Distribution , Workload Projection, or Hardware Replace. Either load a saved plan, or clear the current plan to create a new and untitled plan. To clear the plan, choose New . To load a plan, choose Open , and then pick the plan you want to load. Make any special settings you need for the type of planning scenario you want to run. If you are running a Workload Projection , set the projection parameters. The projection parameters determine: The range of time for the projection’s base The projection will perform a linear interpolation based on historical workload data. As you set a time range, the dialog box charts the CPU and memory statistics for that range. Period: how far into the future to project the workload Using the base time range, the &_Plan; will project the workload this far into the future. You can only set these parameters if you are in the Workload Projection tab. In this tab, the Utilization Chart includes controls to set the projection’s base and period. After you run the plan, this chart will show the projection data. For more information, see Workload Projection . If you are replacing hardware, set the scope of the hardware you will replace, and choose templates to describe the new hardware. For more information, see Hardware Replace . Run the plan Run the plan in Normal or Merge mode. Note that Run icon changes to Stop ( ) while a plan is running. You can stop a running plan if necessary. After running a plan, you can review the results according to the type of plan you have run. For more information, see Workload Distribution and Workload Projection .

For example, you can specify that a plan will only run on your Development cluster of PMs. In that case, the current environment for your plan would only include PMs in the Development cluster, the VMs hosted by those machines, and data stores that support those machines. Likewise, the target results would only correspond to those machines. Scope is determined differently if you select VMs or physical hosts: Scope by VM When you set scope by VMs, &Product_Short; limits the plan to the physical hosts that those VMs are allowed to run on. Likewise, the plan includes all the data stores that are available to the VMs in your scope. Scope by PM When you set scope by PM, &Product_Short; limits the plan to those physical hosts.

Specifying_Query_Field_Conditions.xml	]> Specifying Query Field Conditions You can optionally specify a query condition for a given query field. In this way, you can filter the report to only show specific data. For example, the following figure shows an existing query for the instance_name field that limits it to the storage device named “iSCSISharedDisk1”. The figure also shows a new condition that gets storage latency data from the property_type field. Editing a Field Condition To add a condition, click the plus (+) icon. To remove an existing condition, click its minus (-) icon. To specify a condition: Choose a Field Name — You can choose from the fields that are available for this report. Choose an operation — For example, to match a string, choose “equal”. Specify a value — You can provide a literal string or integer, or you can provide an SQL expression that returns a value. For example, in the above figure the new condition will have the following expression for its value: date(date_sub(now(),interval 1 day)) . As you specify a condition for a field, it is useful to know what values are available in the database for a given field. The Value text box includes a Show Choices link that displays the Field Values Reference list. This list shows values for the database fields. This list shows live values that it gets from the database. For example, the list of values for the instance_name field shows the names of every entity that &Product_Short; has discovered for your environment. Existing Field Values for Instance Name To see a list of values for a field, click the arrow next to that field. To use a value, you can copy it from the list and paste it in the Condition Value text field. For example, you could make a condition such as instance_name = datastore3 to limit your report to information about the entity named datastore3. This Field Value Reference does not show values for calculated fields. The following is a table of these fields, and how the values are treated: Field Name: Value Description utilization A percentage, where 0.5 = 50% stddev_property_value avg_property_value min_property_value max_property_value used_capacity available_capacity capacity A raw number, where the units of measure depend on the resource this field represents.

Specifying_the_Plan_Workload.xml	]> Specifying the Plan Workload The plan workload is determined by the set of VMs that are deployed in your environment, compared to the PMs and Data Stores that provide resources to them. The more VMs you have for a given number of PMs and data stores, the greater the load will be on these physical devices. With a plan you can add or remove VMs, PMs, and Data Stores to see what the target or projected results would be. For example, you can define a plan that adds VMs to the same set of PMs and Data Stores. Or you can upgrade your physical hosts so they have more CPU or memory resources, and see how that would affect the way your environment supports the current crop of VMs. To set the plan’s load, click the Edit Load icon ( ). The dialog box that appears displays a list of the load modifications you can specify. The dialog box gives you actions to perform on VMs, physical hosts, and data stores. The actions you can perform are similar for all three types; examples will show performing these actions for VMs. The actions you can perform are: Add — Add one or more devices to the environment. Add Using Template — Use a template to specify the properties of the devices you want to add. Replace Using Template — Use a template to specify properties, and replace existing devices with these new devices. For example, use this to upgrade a physical host with more memory or CPU resources. Remove — Select the devices you will remove. Change Resource Utilization (for VMs, only) — Increase or decrease the load on selected VMs by a given percentage point. You can also create templates for add and remove operations. For more information, see Creating Templates . Add Select a device to serve as a model of what you want to add, then specify how many copies of that device you want to add to the environment. Choose the Add action. Navigate the list of items to choose which item to add. Specify the number of copies to add, then click Add . The list of items will include folder called New Entities. You can expand that folder to see these items you have added. You can repeat these steps — select another item to copy, specify the number of copies, then click Add . New additions will appear in the New Entities folder. When you have finished adding items to the plan’s load, close the dialog box. Click Close to close the dialog box. Use this option if you want to make more changes to the plan, or if you want to save the plan before you run it. Click Close and Run to close the dialog box and run the plan immediately. Add Using Template Select a template to serve as a model of what you want to add, then specify how many copies of that templated device you want to add to the environment. You can also choose to create a new template or edit an existing template (see Creating Templates ). Choose the Add Using Template action. Choose the template you want to use. Note that in the above example, the templates with IP addresses have been discovered on the indicated hypervisors. Templates without IP addresses in their names have been created by a user of &Product_Short;. You can use either type of template in a plan. Specify the number of copies to add, then click Add . The list of items will include folder called New Entities. You can expand that folder to see these items you have added. You can add other items, and this folder will update to show the new items. When you have finished adding items to the plan’s load, close the dialog box. Click Close to close the dialog box. Use this option if you want to make more changes to the plan, or if you want to save the plan before you run it. Click Close and Run to close the dialog box and run the plan immediately.

Use this option if you want to make more changes to the plan, or if you want to save the plan before you run it. Click Close and Run to close the dialog box and run the plan immediately. Remove Select the items you want to remove from your environment. Choose the Remove action. Navigate the list of items to choose which items you will remove. You can select individual items, or groups of items. Click Remove . When you have finished removing items in the plan’s load, close the dialog box. Click Close to close the dialog box. Use this option if you want to make more changes to the plan, or if you want to save the plan before you run it. Click Close and Run to close the dialog box and run the plan immediately. Change Resource Utilization Use this to see what will happen if the VMs in your environment were to consume a different amount of resources. For example, you can set the scope of your plan to a production cluster, increase the load by 20%, and run a plan. This is the same as saying, “What would happen if all the VMs in my production cluster saw a 20% increase in their consumption of host memory and CPU cycles?” This option is for VMs, only. Select the VMs you want to reallocate, and raise or lower the resource utilization by percentage points. Choose the Change Resource Utilization action. Navigate the list of VMs to choose which ones you will change. You can select individual VMs, or groups of VMs. Ctrl-click to select multiple items. Click Change Load . When you have finished changing VMs in the plan’s load, close the dialog box. Click Close to close the dialog box.

After running this scenario, the table shows a target of 19 hosts, compared to the current environment that uses 25. To achieve 19 hosts, the plan suggests you add two new hosts, and suspend eight of the old ones. The table also shows that the target environment supports 223 VMs, to account for the 20 VMs we added in the setup. Plan Improvements This pane shows charts that compare the current environment to the target in terms of the device type and metrics you choose to plot. To see actual values in tooltips, hover over the data points in the chart. Use the following tools to control the chart display: Choose the type of device to plot — Hosts or datastores.

Supply_Chain_Terminology.xml	]> Supply Chain Terminology &Company; introduces specific terms to express IT resources and utilization in terms of supply and demand. These terms are largely intuitive, but you should be sure you understand how they relate to the issues and activities that are common for IT management. Term: Definition: Commodity The basic building block of &Company; supply and demand. Everything a &Company; product represents or analyzes is a commodity. For example, the CPU capacity or memory that a physical machine can provide is a commodity. The &Product_Short; can also represent clusters and segments as commodities. When the user interface shows commodities , it’s showing the resources a service provides. When the interface shows commodities bought , it’s showing what that service consumes. Composed Of The resources or commodities that make up the given service. For example, in the user interface you might see that a certain VM is composed of commodities such as one or more physical CPUs, an Ethernet interface, and physical memory. Compare Composed Of to Consumes , where consumption refers to the commodities the VM has bought. Also compare Composed Of to the commodities a service offers for sale. A physical machine might include four CPUs in its composition, but the commodities the machine offers will show these CPUs aggregated as a single commodity. Consumes The services and commodities a service has bought. A service consumes other commodities. For example, a VM consumes the commodities offered by a physical machine, and an application consumes commodities from one or more VMs. Note that in the user interface you can explore the services that provide the commodities the current service consumes. Environment The sum of data center, network, physical machine, storage, VM, and application resources that you are monitoring. Inventory The list of all commodities in your environment. Utilization Index A measure of the risk to Quality of Service (QoS) that a consumer will experience. The higher the UI on a provider, the more risk to QoS for any consumer of that provider’s services. For example, a physical machine provides host services to one or more VMs. The higher the UI on the provider, the more likely it is that the VMs will experience QoS degradation. Note that for optimal operation, the UI on a provider should not go into double digits. In the above example, if the PM has a UI of 16 or more, the VMs are very likely to suffer QoS degradation. Service A functioning commodities group such as a physical machine, a VM, or an application. Utilization The percentage over time that a commodity is used, where 100% is utilization of the full capacity. VM Group The collection of VMs running on a given physical machine. Because an environment can have many VMs, the user interface shows VM groups as a way to simplify and organize their presentation.

For example if you need to deploy more applications, you can use this view to calculate where to place new VMs and actually deploy them in your environment. In this way, &Product_Short; provides end-to-end intelligent workload management, from specifying actions to keep your environment in the Optimal Operating Zone, to deploying new VMs in the optimal locations, as calculated by &Product_Short;. There are two ways to specify resource allocation and other details for the VMs you will deploy: Choose templates that are built from discovered data Many hypervisors store source VMs, and copy data from those source files to deploy new VMs. &Product_Short; discovers these source VMs to build templates that you can choose on the &Tab_Deploy; View. Note that discovered templates are read-only — you cannot edit these templates. Choose templates that have been authored in &Product_Short; You can create and edit templates that specify your VM configuration, and use those to specify resources for the new VMs. TERMINOLOGY ISSUE — Some hypervisors refer to source VMs as templates. Within &Product_Short;, templates are files that describe a VM, host, or datastore. For this topic, the word template refers to an &Product_Short; template. VM Templates specify the resources allocated for a VM, and Deployment Profiles specify details such as the datacenter or cluster to host the new VM, and the package files (OVF or VHD) for the source VM. The term source VM refers to the VM deployment data that is stored on a hypervisor. The data in a VM template specifies the resources to allocate for the deployed VMs. When &Product_Short; looks for the appropriate host for the VM, it looks for a host that can best provide these resources. The following topics describe how to use the &Tab_Deploy; view: Deploying VMs Creating and Editing Templates

The_Economic_Scheduling_Engine.xml	]> The Economic Scheduling Engine &Product_Short; tracks the Utilization Index (UI) for specific resources in your environment. The higher this index, the more that resource is utilized, the greater the delay for consumers of that resource, and the greater the risk to your QoS. &Product_Short; constantly works to keep the UI within acceptable bounds. You can think of UI as the cost for a resource—&Product_Short; works to keep the cost at a competitive level. This is not simply a matter of responding to threshold conditions. &Product_Short; analyzes the full range of buyer/seller relationships, and each buyer constantly seeks out the most economical transaction that is available. This last point is crucial to understanding &Product_Short;. The virtual environment is dynamic, with constant changes to workload and optimal workload distribution that correspond with the varying requests your customers make of your applications and services. By examining each buyer/seller relationship, the economic engine arrives at the optimal workload distribution for the current state of the environment. For example, assume a PM that hosts one VM with a critical application, and two VMs with non-critical applications. Consider these similar situations: The critical application has increased use, and the non-critical applications are dormant In this case, &Product_Short; can suspend the two unused VMs (reduce VM sprawl) and devote more host resources to the critical application. The critical application has increased use, and both non-critical applications see increased use In this case, &Product_Short; can move the non-critical VMs to another host and devote more host resources to the critical application. This is an over-simple case, but it illustrates the value of constant analysis of all the relationships. For the critical application, the results are the same. But for the environment as a whole, the results arrive at different, economical solutions, to reflect the given conditions. The economic engine considers all the entities and resources in your environment, and analyzes them asynchronously to constantly tend toward the optimal operating zone. In principal, you can run &Product_Short; with nothing more than its default settings. However, it’s likely that your environment has special services and resources that require different management decisions. &Product_Short; provides a full range of policies that you can set to control how the software manages specific groups of entities. However, before you make such policy settings, you should understand how &Product_Short; works by default. For more information about policies, see The Policy View .

The_Market_and_Virtual_Currency.xml	]> The Market and Virtual Currency To perform intelligent workload management, &Product_Short; models the environment as a market, and uses market analysis to manage resource supply and demand. For example, bottlenecks form when local workload demand exceeds the local capacity—in other words, when demand exceeds supply. By modeling the environment as a market, &Product_Short; can use economic solutions to efficiently redistribute the demand or increase the supply. &Product_Short; uses two sets of abstraction to model the environment: Modeling the physical and virtual IT stack as a service supply chain The supply chain models devices in your environment as managed entities. These include applications, VMs, host machines (physical machines, or PMs), storage, and data centers. Every entity is a buyer and/or a seller. A host machine buys physical space, power, and cooling from a data center. The PM sells host resources such as CPU cycles and memory to VMs. In turn, VMs buy host services, and then sell their hosting services (VMem and VCPU) to applications. Using virtual currency to represent delay or QoS degradation, and to manage the supply and demand of services along the modeled supply chain. The system uses virtual currency to value these buy/sell transactions. Each managed entity has a running budget, and draws from that budget to pay for the resources it consumes. The price of a resource is driven by its utilization — the more demand for a resource, the higher its price. Modeling the Environment as a Market These abstractions open the whole range of the environment to a single mode of analysis—market analysis. Resources and services can be priced to reflect changes in supply and demand, and pricing can drive resource allocation decisions. For example, a bottleneck (excess demand over supply) results in rising prices of the given resource. Applications competing for the same resource can lower their costs by shifting their workloads to other resource suppliers. As a result, utilization for that resource evens out across the environment and the bottleneck is resolved.

The_Operations_Manager_Supply_Chain.xml	]> The &Product_Short; Supply Chain &Product_Short; models your environment as a market of buyers and sellers. At its simplest, a market model could classify each entity as just a buyer and a seller. However, a virtual environment has tiers of resources and services. Also, different targets that &Product_Short; can monitor represent different tiers or groupings. For example, a hypervisor represents applications, VMs, PMs, data stores, and data centers, while a load balancer represents virtual applications and a cloud stack represents virtual data centers. These tiers form a chain of supply and demand, where one tier supplies resources to meet the demands of another tier.

The_Optimal_Operating_Zone.xml	]> The Optimal Operating Zone The goal of workload management is to assure performance while maintaining efficient use of resources. When performance and efficiency are both maintained, you are in the optimal operating zone. You can measure performance as a function of delay, where zero delay gives the ideal QoS for a given service. Efficient use of resources is a function of utilization where 100% utilization of a resource is the ideal for the most efficient utilization. If you plot delay and utilization, the result is an asymptotic curve. Up to a point, as you increase utilization, the increase in delay is slight. There comes a point on the curve where a slight increase in utilization results in an unacceptable increase in delay. On the other hand, there is a point in the curve where a reduction in utilization doesn’t yield a meaningful increase in QoS. The optimal operating zone lies within these points on the curve. You could set a threshold to post an alert whenever the upper limit is crossed. In that case, you would never react to a problem until delay has already become unacceptable. To avoid that late reaction you could set the threshold to post an alert before the upper limit is crossed. In that case, you guarantee QoS at the cost of over-provisioning—you increase operating costs and never achieve efficient utilization. Instead of responding after a threshold is crossed, &Product_Short; analyzes the operating conditions and constantly recommends actions to keep the entire environment within the optimal operating zone. If you execute these actions (or let &Product_Short; execute them for you), the environment will maintain operating conditions that assure performance for your customers, while saving you as much as possible by efficient utilization of your resources. For a quick view of your current environment and how it is converging on the Optimal Operating Zone, see The Workload View .

Using this analysis, it displays utilization charts and tables in a Summary panel. These summaries show metrics for your current configuration, as well as target metrics — the metrics you can achieve by performing the recommended actions to optimize system deployment. Beneath the Summary panel, &Product_Short; shows a To Do list of recommended actions (see To Do Lists - Maintaining QoS for more information). You can use the &_Advise; to analyze and pro actively address problems related to workload and resource distribution among physical hosts and storage devices. Further, &_Advise; can automatically perform most recommended actions that do not include changes to physical configurations of hosts or storage. Once you execute a recommended action, the environment changes. &Product_Short; performs its analysis again and presents further actions you can perform to optimize your deployment. In this way, you can iteratively change your configuration and workload distribution to improve overall performance.

A scenario shows a summary of your resulting environment, utilization charts for your resources, as well as recommended actions you can perform to achieve the desired results. For example, assume you run a plan that adds virtual machines to a cluster. The summary might show that you gain a lower and more evenly spread utilization index if you add more virtual machines to a smaller number of physical hosts. The recommended actions would then indicate which hosts you can take offline, and how to distribute your virtual machines among the remaining hosts. To use the &_Plan;, open the Plan view, then create and run plans. The following figure shows the &_Plan; user interface, with these features: The summary shows that the utilization index has been evened out across all the host machines. The green plot is the resulting index, while the bars on the chart indicate the current utilization index. You can display charts for utilization index, memory consumption, CPU percentage, IO utilization, and network utilization.

In the load balancer, each virtual application has bindings to the applications it manages. End users make requests to the virtual application, and the load balancer forwards those requests to the actual applications. Synopsis Budget: A virtual server has unlimited budget to buy application resources. As a result, a virtual application will never be suspended. Provides: Transactions to end users and other applications. Consumes: Applications running on VMs. Discovered through: &Product_Short; discovers virtual application servers through load balancer targets (see Adding and Removing Target Virtual Management Servers ). Load balancers manage the traffic of requests to applications in your environment. The virtual application is a logical construct of the load balancer. For information about binding load-balanced applications to the virtual application, see Load Balancer Discovery . &fmv1; monitors the following resources for a virtual application: Transaction (transactions per second) The percentage utilization of the allocated transactions per second for the given virtual application. &Product_Short; does not recommend actions to perform on the virtual application itself, but it does recommend actions to perform on the VMs that host bound applications. For example, assume a virtual application that manages three SQL databases. If a surge in requests degrades performance across all three databases, then &Product_Short; can start a new VM to run another instance of the database application, and bind it to the virtual application. On the other hand, if SQL requests drop off so that the load balancer only forwards requests to two of the databases, &Product_Short; can suspend the dormant database and unbind it from the virtual application.

IOPS (Storage Access Operations per Second) The percentage utilization of IOPS allocated for the VStorage on the VM. Latency The percentage utilization of latency allocated for the VStorage on the VM, measured in ms. &fmv19; recommends the following actions for a VM: Start a new VM for: High resource utilization on VM High resource utilization on hosting PM Excess IOPS or Latency in VStorage Terminate (Remove) VM For a VM that has been suspended for a long period. Suspend VM For low utilization of VM’s resources. Move VM for: High resource utilization on VM High resource utilization on hosting PM Excess IOPS or Latency in VStorage Workload placement violation Hosting PM is underutilized (move before suspending PM) Move VM Storage For excess utilization of the current datastore, or for more efficient utilization of datastores in the environment.

Storage Extension features include: VM moves across volumes the same or different disk arrays Actions to resize, suspend, and remove volumes and disk arrays Storage controller analysis that takes into account the impact of deduplication, compression, and data scrubbing Desired State calculations that account for thick and thin provisioning, deduplication, snapshot space, and a range of storage types (SSD and various spindle speeds) For more information about disk array support, see The &Product_Short; Supply Chain . Storage Cluster Support &Product_Short; now discovers storage clusters and limits VM moves accordingly. If a VM uses storage that is within a storage cluster, all moves of that storage will remain within that cluster. High Availability Support &Product_Short; now discovers VMWare HA configurations in clusters, and considers the reserved resources in its calculations. For tolerated host failures, or a reserved percentage of cluster resources, &Product_Short; automatically sets utilization constraints for that cluster (see Utilization Constraints ). If you configure a failover host, &Product_Short; reserves that host for HA and will not move VMs to it. You can see a failover icon ( ) on the reserved host in the Inventory tree. Export Dashboards to PDF You can now export the current display in dashboards to PDF files. This is a way to generate reports based on the data you see in the &fmv1; user interface.

Workload State Charts	]> The Workload View The &Tab_Workload; View gives a unique perspective on the distribution of workload throughout your environment. At a glance, you can see how the VMs in your environment are utilized, and how these VMs utilize their underlying Host and Storage resources. The view displays two charts Current Workload — The current distribution of workload in the environment Desired Workload — The workload distribution the environment would achieve if you executed the current set of recommended actions The workload charts plot physical utilization of host and storage resources along the X and Y axes. These measure either the utilization index value or the percentage utilization of the given host and storage providers. The chart is divided into a grid, and it places rings on that grid. Each ring represents a set of VMs with given host and storage utilization values. A ring’s center is within a given grid sector, and all the VMs represented by that ring exhibit utilization values within the range described by that sector. The size of the ring indicates how many VMs exhibit that utilization. A ring also shows information about the most critical VM among those it represents. The ring color indicates the status of the most critical VM in that set. This is a function of VM utilization, and not the utilization of the physical host and storage resources. For this reason, it’s possible that a green ring can be in a very high-value grid sector. Conversely, a red ring can show low physical resource utilization. The center of a ring indicates the resource utilization for the most critical VM in a ring. If a ring is centered in the top-right of a sector, then that shows the physical resource consumption of the most critical VM. All other VMs in that ring are located in the same sector, even if the ring extends over neighboring sectors. To summarize, the charts show the following: Physical resource utilization The horizontal and vertical axes show utilization of resources on the PMs and storage devices that host the charted VMs. Each ring is located in a grid sector to indicate the consumed physical resources. Number of VMs with given Host/Storage utilization One ring represents one or more VMs. The ring’s VMs utilize the resources indicated by the given grid sector. The diameter of the ring indicates how many VMs share that grid sector. Severity of VM utilization Ring color shows the utilization of the most critical VM among those represented by the given ring.
