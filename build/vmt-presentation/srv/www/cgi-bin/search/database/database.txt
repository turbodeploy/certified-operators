VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Action Categories	Action Categories Operations Manager organizes entries in the To Do log into different categories. These categories do not strictly define the severity of an issue, but they indicate the nature of the issue. Prevention Operations Manager constantly monitors conditions, and works to keep your environment running in the optimal operating zone. As it finds issues that risk moving entities out of this zone, it places these issues in the Prevention category. You should attend to these issues, and perform the associated actions. If you do not, the environment may drift out of the operating zone, and the QoS for some services may be put at risk. Actions Risks/Opportunities Move VM Start VM or PM &lt;Resource&gt; Congestion High resource utilization on the named VM, host, or datastore. For example, CPU congestion or Memory congestion can occur on a VM or physical machine. Excess latency on a data stream. For example, an IOPs bottleneck can occur on a datastore. Workload Balancing Excess workload on a given physical machine that can be addressed by moving a VM to another host. Performance Assurance Ultimately, the reason to keep your environment running within the optimal operating zone is to assure performance and meet QoS goals. When Operations Manager detects conditions that directly put QoS at risk, it places the associated actions and risks in the Performance Assurance category. You can consider these critical conditions, and you should execute the recommended actions as soon as possible. Actions Risks/Opportunities Connect a new application (to virtual application server) Provision a new VM, PM, Datastore Increase number of VCPUs Decrease number of VCPUs Increase resource Reduce resource &lt;Resource&gt; Congestion High utilization of application managed by a load balancer. High utilization of resources on VM, PM, or datastore. Compliance A virtual environment can include policies that limit workload placement or availability of resources. It&#8217;s possible that the environment configuration violates these defined policies. It&#8217;s also possible that an entity is mis configured in some way. For example, a VM might be configured to access a network that is not available in its current cluster. In such cases, Operations Manager identifies the violation and recommends actions that bring the entity back into compliance. Actions Risks/Opportunities Move VM Provision VM, PM, Datastore, Network Placement Violation The placement of a VM is in violation of an Operations Manager policy or an imported Placement Policy. Misconfiguration The configuration violates discovered requirements. For example, a VM is configured to access a network that is not available from the current cluster. Efficiency Improvement Efficient utilization of resources is an important part of running in the optimal operating zone. Running efficiently maximizes your investment in hardware and reduces cost. When Operations Manager discovers underutilized resources, it recommends actions to consolidate your operations. For example, it can recommend that you move certain VMs onto a different host. This can free a physical machine to be shut down. There are times when Operations Manager suspends a VM in order to free up resources for a critical application. When those resources are no longer stressed by the critical application, Operations Manager can restart the suspended VM. This is a special type of efficiency improvement&#8212;rather than consolidating workload and shutting down unused machines, this action restarts a suspended VM to increase resource utilization and provide more services. Actions Risks/Opportunities Disconnect Virtual App Move VM Suspend VM Delete VM Terminate VM Reduce resource Restart suspended VM Overprovisioning Excess resource capacity in a PM or datastore.

Action_Modes.html	Action_Modes.html	157239	25	5571	Action Modes When Operations Manager uncovers bottlenecks, over provisioning, or other...	VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Action Modes	Action Modes When Operations Manager uncovers bottlenecks, over provisioning, or other issues, it can then identify and perform actions that will resolve those issues and restore the environment to the Optimal Operating Zone. You can specify how Operations Manager should handle the actions it identifies for hosts and VMs. Supported Actions Operations Manager doesn&#8217;t automate the same actions equally for all hypervisors. For example, assume you set the Suspend action to be automated for all VMs. In that case, Operations Manager can automate suspension for VMs managed by vCenter and XenServer, but it cannot automatically suspend VMs managed by Hyper-V. Note that Operations Manager will perform automation for the VMs that it can, and recommend suspension for Hyper-V VMs. The following table lists actions Operations Manager supports on each hypervisor, showing whether it can automate the actions, or only recommend them. indicates full automation support indicates recommended-only actions Host Action vCenter XenServer Hyper-V VCD Start Suspend Remove (Terminate) Provision VM Action vCenter XenServer Hyper-V VCD Start Move Suspend Remove (Terminate) Change (Move to Different Storage) Add Storage Remove Storage Reconfigure (Change network and storage configurations) Resize (Change VCPU and memory capacities) Storage Action vCenter XenServer Hyper-V VCD Remove (Terminate) Provision Note that for VCloud Director datacenters Operations Manager only supports resize actions. However, it can automate actions for the underlying VMs and hosts because they are managed by vCenter. Action Mode Settings For each action Operations Manager can perform you can specify the action mode, or how it will handle the action. Operations Manager supports the following action modes: Disabled &#8212; Do not recommend or perform the action Recommended &#8212; Recommend the action so a user can perform it using the given hypervisor or by other means Manual &#8212; Recommend the action, and provide the option to perform that action through the VMTurbo Operations Manager user interface Automated &#8212; Operations Manager performs the action automatically The following figure shows override settings for a group of Development hosts. In this case, Operations Manager will automatically start physical machines in this group. To set modes for all hosts in the environment, you should make global settings for the given action (see Global Settings ). Setting Action Modes for a Group To get the best results from Operations Manager&#8217;s Intelligent Workload Management, you should set as many actions as possible to Automated . In that case, you should set the actions to Automated at the global level. If some clusters run applications that are highly critical, you can override the global setting for those clusters, and set them to Manual . Scheduling Automatic Actions For some clusters or groups of devices, you might want to automate actions, but only during off-peak hours. Operations Manager includes a scheduling utility that you can use to specify time windows when you can allow or disallow automation. NOTE: The Operations Manager Economic Scheduling Engine continually calculates actions that will bring your environment into the Optimal Operating Zone. These actions are in response to the environment at a given point in time. When you set a specific time window to automate a given action, Operations Manager will only calculate and perform actions that are appropriate for the environment at that scheduled time. You should review manual actions during time periods when automation is disabled, so you can manually adjust the environment in response to peak states. By default, the global settings for all actions have no scheduling policies set to them. If you globally set the VM Move action to Automated, then VMTurbo Operations Manager will automatically execute any recommended VM move actions whenever they arise &#8212; 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Scheduling policies enable you to modify this, for global policies or as overrides to global policies scoped to specific groups. (For information about policy scope, see Global Settings .) For example, assume you want to always automate Resize for all but the most critical VMs. You would set Resize VMs to Automated at a global level. Then for a critical cluster, you would set a scheduling policy that overrides the automation (sets Resize to Manual) during peak hours (9:00 to 5:00 m-f). You can also schedule automation in reverse fashion. For example, if you want to automate only one set of VMs, you can set Resize to Manual at the global level, and for one cluster you can schedule it to be Automated for a given time window. Creating a Simple Schedule Policy To schedule a time window for an automated action: 1. Set the scope for this action. You can set global scope, or scope for a given cluster. 2. Open the schedule calendar and click Create New Policy . You can select the schedule policy start date beforehand in the calendar, or set it as you create the policy. 3. Specify the settings for this schedule policy. The date range determines how long the policy will be in effect. You should keep the following points in mind: A non-recurring policy has a start date, and no end date. The policy is in effect for the day you specify as the start date. For recurring policies you specify a date range. The policy will remain in effect for those dates. For monthly recurrence, the policy is in effect for one day a month &#8212; the day you set for the Start Date. But the policy recurrence remains in effect until the End Date. For example, if you specify the 1st of January for the start date, and the 31st of December for the end date, the policy will be in effect on the first of each month for that year. For any given day, the policy can be in effect from 00:00 through 24:00. If you want an action mode to span two days, you must specify two policies. For example, to enable automation from 22:00 to 06:00, you must create two policies &#8212; On from 22:00 to 24:00, and another from 0:00 to 06:00. Note that you can set different label colors for your policies. This is a good way to track policies of a similar type. For example, you could use red for policies on critical clusters, and green for policies on prototyping clusters. 4. When you have the settings you want, click Create . The policy appears in the calendar. When you select a day in the calendar, the policies list shows all the policies for that day. Hover over a policy to display details in a tooltip. Tie-break Results When the same resource instance has conflicting settings, the most conservative setting wins.

However, ion order to discover and manage these vDCs, Operations Manager needs login credentials for each one. If your vDCs use the same credentials as the vCloud Director server, then you do not need to provide VC Username and VC Password. However, if the vDCs use different credentials, then you must provide them in addition to the vCloud Director credentials.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Adding Hyper-V Servers as Targets	Adding Hyper-V Servers as Targets To add a Hyper-V server as a target, you must provide domain\username in the User Name field. In addition, the user that you specify must be one of the server&#8217;s WBEM Scripting Locater owners. Each Hyper-V server requires specific permissions to allow management via WMI. These permissions are set in the host&#8217;s WBEM Scripting Locater registry key. To set the permissions, edit the registry key to add owners and grant them full control. To add an owner to the Hyper-V server&#8217;s registry key: 1. Launch regedit on that machine as Administrator 2. Find the following registry key: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{76A64158-CB41-11D1-8B02-00600806D9B6} 3. Right click the key and choose Permissions 4. Click Advanced and display the Owner tab 5. In the owners list, add the user you want to allow to connect to the machine 6. Click Ok 7. Highlight the user and grant Full Control Once you have done this you can specify the Hyper-V server as an Operations Manager target, using credentials for an owner that has Full Control privileges. Adding Multiple Hyper-V Servers You can add Hyper-V targets as one at a time, by providing the host name or IP address of each. If you have many such Hyper-V servers, it is more efficient to use a single command to add all the Hyper-V servers that are in a cluster. To do this, provide the following information: Host Name or IP Address &#8212; Any valid address for a Hyper-V server within the cluster Full Domain Name &#8212; The full domain name for the given cluster Username and Password &#8212; Credentials that are valid for all the Hyper-V servers in the cluster (see above for information about enabling WMI management) Adding a Hyper-V Target When you specify a full domain name for the cluster, Operations Manager discovers all the Hyper-V servers within that cluster and adds them as targets. In addition, Operations Manager monitors your environment and automatically adds new targets whenever it discovers a new Hyper-V server in the cluster.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Adding Load Balancers as Targets	Adding Load Balancers as Targets Adding a Load Balancer Target To add a load balancer as a target, you specify the IP address and credentials for the load balancer. Operations Manager discovers the service types that are assigned to that load balancer. These service types appear in the Operations Manager supply chain as virtual applications. To enable discovery of virtual applications, you must configure load balancer discovery. Configuring Load Balancer Discovery After you add a load balancer as a target, you must configure Operations Manager to discover the virtual applications that load balancer manages. The steps to do this are: 1. Specify discovery for the applications the load balancer will manage The load balancer manages workload across instances of running applications in your environment. Operations Manager must be configured to discover and manage these running applications before it can recognize that they are managed by the load balancer. For example, To specify discovery of a specific application, you define its application signature and then provide credentials for the given protocol (WMI, SNMP, or JMX) that Operations Manager can use to access the VMs that host the application. For more information, see Application Discovery . 2. Assign application signatures to specific virtual applications Operations Manager discovers the virtual applications that the load balancer uses to manage applications. After you have specified signatures and discovery for the applications you want the load balancer to manage, you can then assign those application signatures to specific virtual applications. For more information, see Load Balancer Discovery . For example, assume the load balancer uses virtual applications named web and sql to manage web servers and SQL databases. Also assume that you have defined an application signature named IIS for IIS Web Server applications, and another signature named SQL for Microsoft SQL Server applications. In that case, you need to map the IIS signature to the web virtual application, and SQL to the sql virtual application. Now Operations Manager can discover these applications and represent them as the running components within the load balancer.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Adding vCloud Director Servers as Targets	Adding vCloud Director Servers as Targets If you have installed the Cloud Operations Manager license, you can add vCloud Director (VCD) servers as targets. To add a VCD server, you specify the login address and credentials for the VCD machine, as well as user name and password for the vCenter hypervisors managed by this VCD server. Adding a vCloud Director Server For a VCD target, Operations Manager discovers the virtual datacenters (VDCs) that are managed by that target. To discover all the resources in these VDCs, Operations Manager must access the vCenter hypervisors that manage them. However, in order to discover and manage these vCenter hypervisors, Operations Manager needs login credentials for each one. Operations Manager uses VC Username and VC Password to access these vCenter servers. VC Username is an optional field. If you do not provide this value, Operations Manager will obtain the VC username that is specified in the vCloud Director&#8217;s configuration. Even if you leave this field blank, you must provide a valid password for the obtained username. When specifying VC credentials, you should consider the following: Operations Manager uses the same credentials for all vCenter servers associated with this vCloud Director target. Operations Manager adds all these vCenter servers to the targets list. If the credentials are not valid for a vCenter Server, Operations Manager shows it in the list of targets, but it has a Target Status of Not Valid .

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Aggregated Operations Manager Installations	Aggregated Operations Manager Installations For large virtual environments, you can use more than one Operations Manager instance to manage your workload. This can offer two advantages: Scaling up to manage larger inventories Separation by region, line of business, customer, or other criteria NOTE: For separation of data, you can also use a single instance of Operations Manager and assign scope to user accounts. For example, this is a way to achieve separation by customer within a single instance of Operations Manager. For more information, see Setting Scope for a User Account . By aggregating multiple instances in this way, you can view the entire environment through a single GUI. One special installation of Operations Manager serves as the aggregating instance , and it displays the combined data of each underlying target instance . This brings together the recommended actions, dashboards and summary displays, reporting, and other data in one application view. In this architecture, each target instance has its own set of target hypervisors, and manages its associated workload. Users can log onto these instances &#8220;locally&#8221; as they normally would, and use their GUIs to perform administration tasks, review and perform recommended actions, run plans, or perform any other task a user can perform with Operations Manager. But aggregation offers more. The aggregation instance treats the underlying instances as its target servers. Users can log onto the aggregation instance and use the GUI to manage the aggregated environment by executing recommended actions, viewing aggregated dashboards and summary panels, and performing other tasks. You perform these tasks through the aggregating GUI, but you can effect changes on the inventory managed by the underlying Operations Manager instances. NOTE: An aggregating instance cannot manage hypervisors and aggregated target instances at the same time. All the targets of an aggregating instance must be target instances of Operations Manager.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Aggregated User Accounts and Login	Aggregated User Accounts and Login When you create a user account on the aggregating instance, the same account gets pushed to all the target instances. In this way, a user with an account on the aggregating instance can then log onto any of the underlying target instances. For example, a user can open target instances from the aggregating instance GUI, and then set policies for those targets. Even though you can create an account from an aggregating instance, and then push it to the target instances, user accounts are stored locally on each instance. As a result, accounts can get out of sync. If a target was added to your aggregating instance after your account was already created , then you won&#8217;t necessarily have an account on the new target. To remedy this situation, ask the administrator of the target to create an account for you with identical settings (username, password, role, etc.) to your current aggregating account.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Aggregation Details	Aggregation Details The aggregation instance provides a view of the whole environment that is being managed by the target instances. The aggregating instance requests data from the target instances as its GUI needs the data. The following list provides details of how the aggregation instance manages data from the target instances. System-defined Groups Operations Manager automatically groups devices in your environment into clusters and other groups. For example, it lists datastores by storage type, or VMs by storage. The aggregating instance adds the aggregated devices to these groups as appropriate. For example, if the different target instances all include iSCSI disks, then the aggregating instance shows all of these disks in the same iSCSI group. You can select these groups or items in these groups to set the scope of the aggregating instance. Custom Groups The aggregating instance displays all the custom groups that are defined in the target instances. You can select these groups or items in these groups to set the scope of the aggregating instance. You can create groups on the aggregating instance that include devices from different target instances. Groups you create on the aggregating instance have no effect on the target instances. To Do List On the aggregating instance, the To Do list shows recommended actions for all the target instances. If manual execution for the action is enabled on the target instance, then you can select that action and execute it from the aggregating instance. This sends a message to the corresponding target instance, which executes then the action. Home View The Project Cluster Resources dashboard is not aggregated. This dashboard displays a list of target instances &#8212; You can log into these instances to project cluster resources. For the other dashboards, the data you see shows a combination of the target instances. For example, the Assure Service Performance dashboard shows information for the total of all hosts in your environment. As you set the scope of the dashboard, you can choose from all the groups and clusters in the environment. Inventory View The data you see in the summary panels shows a combination of the target instances. For example if your target instances each manage a number of LSASS applications, the navigation list will show the total of all these applications under the heading for LSASS. You can select groups to set the scope of this view. Plan View Plans are not aggregated. The Plan view displays a list of target instances. You can log into these instances to run plans on them. Deploy View The Deploy view displays a list of target instances. You can log into these instances to deploy VMs on them. Optimize View The data you see in this view shows a combination of the target instances. You can select groups to set the scope of this view. Admin View On the aggregating instance, this view supports the following tasks: License Configuration License configuration for the aggregating instance gets pushed down to the target instances. For information about applying licenses, see License Configuration . User Authentication Configuration You can manage user accounts for the aggregating instance. These accounts get pushed down to the target instances as well. For more information, see Aggregated User Accounts and Login and User Authentication Configuration . Maintenance Maintenance actions such as software updates and diagnostics are for the aggregation instance, only. The target instances must perform their own maintenance activities. For more information, see Maintenance . Policy View The Policy view displays a list of target instances. You can log into these instances to specify policies on them. Reports The Reporting button displays a list of target instances. You can log into these instances to run their reports. Individual devices in the navigation tree includes buttons to generate reports on demand. When you click this icon, the aggregating instance passes the request to the appropriate target instance, which generates the report.

Analysis.html	Analysis.html	157239	28	8626	Analysis As Operations Manager gathers metrics, it compares the metric values...	VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Analysis	Analysis As Operations Manager gathers metrics, it compares the metric values against specified constraint and capacity settings to determine whether a metric exhibits a problem, how to recommend a problem resolution, and so on. Operations Manager maintains analysis settings for Host and Storage devices. The following figure shows override settings for all NAS storage devices. To make settings for all storage devices in the environment, you should make global settings for Analysis &gt; Host or Analysis &gt; Storage (see Global Settings ). Making Settings for a Storage Group Tie-break Results When the same resource instance has conflicting settings, the most conservative setting wins: Setting type: Most conservative is: Utilization, throughput, and upper bounds Lowest value Latency and lower bounds Highest value Operational Settings Hardware Costs For planning and reporting, Operations Manager uses these values to estimate the cost of changes to your hardware inventory. The following table shows the default settings for hardware cost: Attribute Default Value Host Hardware Cost 9000 Cost of CPU per unit 200 Cost of memory per GB 50 Cost of storage per TB 50 Heatmap Critical Utilization Operations Manager compares utilization metrics in your environment to the operational constraints you specify (see Utilization Thresholds and Storage Settings ). It uses that comparison to set colored notifications in heatmaps, trigger problem notifications, and to classify the problems it finds. The values you set here define what Operations Manager considers critical violations for different metrics. For example, assume you define critical as 80% for a metric. Based on the settings you make for the monitored metrics, Operations Manager then classifies these metrics as follows: If the value is: The classification is: More than 80% of the constraint setting Critically overutilized More than 60% and less than 80% of setting Overutilized For under utilization, assume you define critical as 10% for a metric. Based on the settings you make for the monitored metrics, Operations Manager then classifies these metrics as follows: If the value is: The classification is: Less than 10% and more than 5% of setting Under utilized Less than 5% of analysis setting Critically under utilized The following table shows the default settings for critical utilization: Attribute Default Value Critical Utilization Percent for IOPS 80 Critical Utilization Percent for CPU 80 Critical Utilization Percent for Memory 80 Critical Utilization Percent for IO Throughput 80 Critical Utilization Percent for Net Throughput 80 Critical Utilization Percent for Swapping 80 Critical Utilization Percent for Latency 80 Critical Utilization Percent for Storage Amount 80 Reporting Upper and Lower Bounds The following table shows the default settings for operational constraints on virtual machines. Upper bounds limit the amount of a physical resource that will be devoted to a VM consumer. For example, with a VMem upper bound of 85 Operations Manager will never devote more than 85% of physical memory to VMs running on a host. This ensures the host machine has enough physical memory to perform core operations. Lower bounds identify the percentage utilization that Operations Manager will consider under utilized. For example, with a VMem lower bound of 10, if utilization falls below 10% Operations Manager will consider migrating consumers to another host and suspending the under utilized physical machine. Attribute Default Value VMem Utilization Upper Bound 85 VCPU Utilization Upper Bound 85 VMem Utilization Lower Bound 10 VCPU Utilization Lower Bound 10 VStorage Utilization Upper Bound 85 Aggressivenes Factor This setting determines how aggressively the appliance will be in recommending changes to your environment. The lower the value, the more aggressive it will be. The default value for this setting is 0 (zero). Resize Recommendation Settings When Operations Manager recommends changes to virtual resources, it uses increments as it calculates how much to raise or lower the given value, and a Rate of Resize to specify how many increments to apply in a single resize action. NOTE: For CloudStack environments, resize is determined by templates. Resize Increments have no effect. However, Rate of Resize can affect which template Operations Manager will use for a resize operation. Assume an environment with small , medium , and large templates, and a VM that is set to small needs to be resized to large . If the Rate of Resize is set to Low, Operations Manager might try the medium template first. However, if the setting is High, then Operations Manager will probably use the large template for the initial resize operation. Resize Increments The increments specify how many units to add or subtract when resizing the given resource allocation for a VM. For example, it makes sense to change VMEM by steps of 1024 MB at a time, but for VStorage it&#8217;s better to make changes by 0.5 GB steps. The following table shows the default settings for the Resize increments: Attribute Default Value Increment constant for VMem user value [MB] 1024 Increment constant for VCPU user value [MHz] 1024 Increment constant for VStorage user value [GB] 100000 NOTE: For VMem, you should not set the increment value below 1024. Virtual machines rely on VMem to start up and run. For a VM that is under utilized, Operations Manager will reduce VMem allocation by the increment amount, but it will not leave a VM with zero VMem. For example, if you set this to 512, then Operations Manager could reduce the memory for a VM to 512 Kb. It&#8217;s possible that If the increment is too low, then Operations Manager might allocate insufficient VMem for the machine to operate. Rate of Resize When resizing resources for a VM, Operations Manager calculates the optimal values for VMEM, VCPU and VStorage. But it does not necessarily make a change to that value in one action. Operations Manager uses the Rate of Resize setting to determine how to make the change in a single action, as follows: Low Change the value by one increment, only. For example, if the resize action calls for increasing VMEM, and the increment is set at 1024, Operations Manager increases VMEM by 1024 MB. Medium Change the value to be halfway between the current value, and the optimal value. For example, if the current VMEM is 2 GB and the optimal VMEM is 8 GB, then Operations Manager will raise VMEM to 5 GB (or as close to that as the increment constant will allow). High Change the value to be the optimal value. For example, if the current VMEM is 2 GB and the optimal VMEM is 8 GB, then Operations Manager will raise VMEM to 8 GB (or as close to that as the increment constant will allow). The default setting for Rate of Resize is Medium . Utilization Thresholds Operations Manager uses the thresholds you set for specific metrics when it analyzes your environment and recommends changes that will achieve the optimal targets. The following table shows the default settings for operational constraints on physical machines. Attribute Default Value Max Storage IOPS Utilization 100 Max Storage Latency Utilization 100 Max Host CPU Utilization 100 Max Host Memory Utilization 100 Max Host IO Throughput 20 Max Host Net Throughput 20 Max Host Swapping Utilization 100 Max Storage Latency Utilization 100 Advanced The advanced settings adjust the overall analysis performed by the economic scheduling engine. You can adjust how Operations Manager calculates recommended actions, as well as the optimal utilization Operations Manager will try to achieve for physical devices. Calculation Adjustments The Time Range Constant sets the number of days Operations Manager will look into the past when making recommendations to decrease the resources available to a VM or application. Operations Manager makes suggestions to reduce resources on a daily basis. (Note that Operations Manager can make recommendations to increase resources every 10-minute cycle. For these recommendations it looks back 24 hours.) Weights for peaks and averages specify how much peak and average metric values will affect calculations. For example, a high weight for peaks means that peak metric values are highly significant when calculating over utilization. However, you might have an application that uses 100% CPU for very short transient events. To suppress the way Operations Manager responds to these transient events, you can set a lower value for Weight for Peaks . The following table shows the default settings for overall Operations Manager settings. Attribute Default Value Time Range Constant 100 Weight for Peaks 99 Weight for Averages 50 Target Utilization When you provide values, these settings specify the optimal target you want for utilization of system resources. Operations Manager will analyze current utilization and recommend or perform changes that seek to achieve the target you set here. Use these settings to specify the balance you want between performance (quality of service) and efficiency. If you set the balance in favor of efficiency, Operations Manager tends to place more VMs on fewer physical hosts, and to give storage capacity from fewer data stores. As a result, high utilization can have more impact on QoS. With a balance in favor of performance, Operations Manager tends to spread virtual loads across more physical devices. NOTE: The setting for Target Utilization can have an effect on plans that you run. If you restrict planning to the current hardware inventory (don&#8217;t add new hardware), then you should always set a value of zero for Target Utilization. The default value for Target Utilization is 70, with a range of 10. When you provide a Target Utilization value, Operations Manager varies market calculations in an attempt to arrive at the zone you specify. Note that as you move the sliders, a tooltip displays the numerical value of the setting you make. For example, assume you want utilization of your resources to center on 75%, with a tolerance of plus/minus 10%. In other words, you consider 65% to be under-utilization, 85% to be over-utilization, and 75% to be optimal utilization. To achieve that, you would specify: Target Utilization = 75 Range for Target Utilization = 20 The following table shows the default settings for target utilization: Attribute Default Value Target Utilization 70 Range for Target Utilization 10 Copyright &copy; 2010 - 2013, VMTurbo All rights reserved	 				Policy_Scope.html#50601995_635706 Analysis.html#50601995_748557 Storage_Settings.html#50601995_748904

Applications1.html	Applications1.html	157239	8	2527	Applications In a virtualized environment, an application is a process running...	VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Applications	Applications In a virtualized environment, an application is a process running on a VM. Applications typically serve human users, or other applications. Synopsis Budget: An application gains its budget to buy resources as a function of its activity. The more active an application is (the more transactions the application performs), the more Operations Manager assumes the application is selling its services to a user. This gives the application more budget to purchase resources from a hosting VM. Operations Manager doesn&#8217;t perform actions on applications. Instead, it performs actions on the host VMs. If utilization is high enough on an application, Operations Manager can create a new copy of the host VM. When an application is idle, it loses budget. Ultimately, if the budget falls enough, Operations Manager will suspend or terminate the host VM. You can declare that an application is critical. Doing this gives the application unlimited budget, so its host VM will never be suspended. For more information, see Application Priority . Provides: Transactions to other applications, to load balancer Virtual Application Servers, and to end users. Consumes: VM resources, including VCPU, VMem, and VStorage. Discovered through: Operations Manager uses WMI, SNMP, or JMX to discover applications through the current target hypervisors (see Adding and Removing Target Virtual Management Servers ). Operations Manager displays applications in the inventory as follows: Applications By default, Operations Manager discovers the following applications: Application Name Description LSASS Microsoft Active Directory services IIS Microsoft Internet Information Services XenDesktop Citrix XenDesktop VMView VMWare View MSSQL Microsoft SQL Server SharePoint Microsoft Sharepoint Server Guest Load The resources that Operations Manager has not assigned to any specific application (for more information, see Guest Load ) In addition, your installation of Operations Manager might be configured to discover other applications running in your environment.

Application_Discovery.html	Application_Discovery.html	157239	14	5882	Application Discovery Operations Manager discovers applications via WMI (for applications on...	VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Application Discovery	Application Discovery Operations Manager discovers applications via WMI (for applications on Windows VMs) and SNMP or JMX (for applications on other VMs). NOTE: For SNMP monitoring, Operations Manager receives trap messages via port 162. For Operations Manager to perform application discovery, it requires: The appropriate agent running on the given VM For VMs running Windows, the VM must have a WMI agent running on it For SNMP discovery, VMs must have a running SNMP agent For JMX discovery, the JVM on the virtual machine must be started with a jmxremote port VM Access Credentials for the given protocol (WMI, SNMP, or JMX) Application Signatures to identify the applications you want to discover and manage Application signatures identify running processes that belong to a specific application. Operations Manager ships with a default set of application signatures &#8212; you can add others to the list. Default Application Discovery By default, Operations Manager discovers the following applications: Application Name Description LSASS Microsoft Active Directory services IIS Microsoft Internet Information Services XenDesktop Citrix XenDesktop VMView VMWare View MSSQL Microsoft SQL Server SharePoint Microsoft Sharepoint Server Guest Load The resources that Operations Manager has not assigned to any specific application (for more information, see Guest Load ) Application Signatures An application signature is a search string that matches process names. A single application may launch a number of processes to perform its job. Rather than tracking each process as a separate application, Operations Manager can group these processes and monitor the group as a single application. Each process must have a unique name, but each process name typically includes part of the name of the main application, or some other text that identifies it as part of the overall application. This name that&#8217;s shared in all the process names is the application signature . Note that the same application signature is valid for WMI and SNMP application discovery. When you make the list of signatures, you do not need to identify what protocol will be used to monitor them. As Operations Manager scans a VM for application processes, it uses the full list of signatures, no matter what the operating system is for that VM. To specify an application signature: 1. Select Application Discovery to display the editor. 2. Create a new application signature. 3. Provide an application name. Application names should be unique. If you provide a name that is identical to a default application name (as described in Default Application Discovery ), then Operations Manager will use your custom application signature when grouping application processes. 4. Enter regular expressions to identify the characters that must be in a Windows process name. You can also specify characters that must not be in the process name. Any process name that satisfies the application signature identifies a member of the given application. For example, assume the following strings: - Match: s.* - No-match: sq.* In this case, the signature would match all process names that begin with 's' , except those that begin with 'sq' . Creating Application Signatures VM Access Credentials To discover and monitor applications, Operations Manager uses WMI on VMs running Windows, and SNMP or JMX on other VMs. You must provide valid credentials for any of the VMs that host applications you want to monitor. NOTE: For WMI application discovery and management, the given target hypervisor requires specific permissions that allow WMI access. For more information, see Adding Hyper-V Servers as Targets . You select VM groups and set specific credentials for those VMs. You can select a top-level group to provide one set of credentials for all the VMs in the inventory, and then select lower-level groups to override the more general settings (for more about settings overrides, see Policy Scope ). Note that you set credentials to groups of VMs, not to individual VMs. To discover applications on all the VMs in a group, all those VMs must honor the same credentials. If the VMs in default groupings don&#8217;t all have the same credentials, you can create custom groups to keep the same credentials together. For information about creating custom groups, see Group Management . You can specify WMI, SNMP, and JMX access credentials for the same group. For example, if the group includes VMs running Windows and Linux, you should specify both a valid windows admin account, and a valid SNMP community. For all VMs in the group, if they are running Windows then they must honor the provided admin credentials; for other operating systems, they must honor the provided SNMP community. The settings to make are: Username: A user with admin rights on the machine Password: That user&#8217;s password SNMP Community: A community string that is valid on the machine JMX Protocol: Can be RMI or JMXMP JMX Port: The port number of the jmxremote port for the VM&#8217;s JVM JMX URL: The URL that Operations Manager uses to establish a client connection with the VM&#8217;s JVM Retry Interval: The minimum amount of time to wait before trying to log into a machine again It&#8217;s common to configure machines so they will lock out any login attempts after a certain number of unsuccessful attempts. The lockout typically stays in effect for a given time (15 or 30 minutes, for example). Operations Manager logs in to poll for applications every 20 minutes. You should set the retry interval to a value larger than the lockout time that is specified for the machine. This will avoid unnecessary lockouts in case the credentials you provide here are incorrect. The default retry interval value is 60 minutes. The following figure shows settings for the applications that run on VMs in a specific cluster. To set credentials for all VMs in the environment, you would select a top-level item in the Scope list. Setting Discovery Credentials for Applications in a Cluster Credentials are inherited. For example, you can select the top-level group Virtual Machines and provide one set of credentials. Then you can select lower-level groups and provide override credentials. The lowest-level credential specification wins. The following image shows settings for all VMs (the top-level group). This means that by default Operations Manager will use these credentials when it performs application discovery on a VM: The next image shows settings for a specific VM. You cannot make settings on individual VMs, but you can see the username, and you can also see which group setting is in effect. In this case, Operations Manager will use these credentials for application discovery on that VM. Note that the Application Discovery table shows where this VM&#8217;s credentials are set. In this case, they are set in the top-level group (Virtual Machines). It&#8217;s possible for one VM to belong to many groups. If you need to change the credentials for this machine, you know where they are currently set. You can create another group to set different credentials for this VM.

Application_Priority.html	Application_Priority.html	157239	6	3158	Application Priority Application priority determines the conditions under which Operations Manager...	VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Application Priority	Application Priority Application priority determines the conditions under which Operations Manager recommends to suspend or terminate a VM. Suspending a VM means powering it down, but leaving it in the in the hypervisor&#8217;s list of managed VMs. Terminating a VM means removing it from the hypervisor. When Operations Manager recommends that you terminate a VM, this indicates that the VM is dormant, and no applications are running on it. NOTE: Your environment may include some VMs that you never want to terminate. You might think that you can set all applications to Mission Critical as a way to direct that Operations Manager never recommends termination. In fact, Operations Manager can recommend that you terminate a dormant VM that has Mission Critical applications on it. If you want to never terminate, then you can disable the Terminate action for all VMs or for a group of VMs. For more information, see Action Modes . Operations Manager monitors resource consumption, and works to keep Mission Critical applications running. If a Mission Critical application needs resources and none are immediately available, Operations Manager may recommend suspending non-critical VMs to free up resources and make them available to the critical application. You can specify the priority for applications to be: Mission Critical The focus of Operations Manager is to keep the applications running. For example, it will never suggest suspending the VM that hosts a mission critical application. Normal Operations Manager may suggest suspending a VM that hosts normal applications to free up resources that a mission critical application might need. Low Operations Manager does not consider the needs of low priority applications when calculating the optimal operating zone for your environment. You specify application priority to groups. The most important groups for application priority are: Applications Each group is named for a discovered application, and contains all the instances of that named application. Physical Machines For each physical machines, all the applications running on that machine. If a VM has any Mission Critical applications on it, Operations Manager will always try to find resources for that VM, and will never recommend suspending it in order to free up resources. Operations Manager can recommend terminating a VM with Mission Critical applications, if the VM is truly dormant. For a VM with all Normal applications, if the VM uses resources that are needed elsewhere, then Operations Manager may recommend suspending this VM. For a VM with Low-priority applications, it can recommend to terminate the VM to free up resources. By default, all applications are Mission Critical (see the Global Setting for Application Priority ). NOTE: For each VM Operations Manager defines a Guest Load application. The Guest Load represents all consumption that Operations Manager cannot assign to a specific application. This includes processes for the VM&#8217;s operating system. Operations Manager ignores Guest Load priority when deciding how to free up resources. However, if a VM has only the Guest Load application on it, and that application is set to Low, then Operations Manager may recommend terminating that VM. The following figure shows override settings for the applications hosted by use a specific physical machine. To set priority for all applications in the environment, you should make global settings for Application Priority (see Global Settings ). Setting Priority for the Applications on a Specific Host Tie-break Results When the same resource instance has conflicting settings, the most conservative setting wins.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Assure Service Performance	Assure Service Performance This dashboard illustrates how to assure workloads have the resources they need to perform well. Use this dashboard to prevent performance degradation. You can use this dashboard to inspect the workload and utilization of resources on hosts and on datastores. You can see how VMs utilize resources and what actions you can take to achieve an optimal workload distribution. If utilization levels present risks to the final QoS for end users, this dashboard points out the risks and gives you a list of actions you can take to correct the situation before any problems arise. The dashboard displays this information in the following panels: To Do This panel displays actions you can execute to maintain optimal operating conditions. You can toggle the panel between a To Do list and a list of current risks to service performance. (For a complete description of To Do panels, see To Do Lists - Maintaining QoS .) The To Do list shows actions that you can execute in the following ways: Automatically Operations Manager performs the actions as it recommends them. You don&#8217;t need to do anything to perform these actions. Manually, through Operations Manager Operations Manager shows the actions in the To Do list, with active check boxes you can select. You select the actions to perform, and then click Resolve . Externally, outside of Operations Manager Operations Manager recommends the action, but cannot execute it. Either an Operations Manager policy specifies that the action cannot be executed, or there is no way for Operations Manager to direct the hypervisor to perform the action. For example, there is no way for Operations Manager add more memory to a physical machine. You execute these actions outside of Operations Manager. NOTE: You can specify action policies for VMs, hosts, storage devices, and cloud stacks. These policies determine how to execute each action. You can specify global policies for all entities of each type, and you can also specify policies for specific groups of entities. For more information, see Action Modes . Health The Health chart shows the current status of the physical machines in your environment. You can choose to chart host machines or datastores. The pie chart shows the status of your physical devices. You can click the chart to open a heatmap that lists the status of each physical device. Projected Improvements The Projected Improvements chart shows the current state of your environment, compared to the target results you would achieve if you executed all the recommended actions in the To Do list. The bars show the current state, and the line chart shows the target results. You can set the chart to show data for the hosts or datastores in your environment. When charting hosts, you can select the following metrics to show in the chart: UI &#8212; The Utilization Index, a measure of the overall utilization of resources on the host Mem &#8212; The percentage of the host&#8217;s memory capacity that is utilized, measured in Kbytes CPU &#8212; The percentage of the host&#8217;s CPU capacity that is utilized, measured in MHz IO &#8212; The percentage of the host&#8217;s IO capacity that is utilized Net &#8212; The percentage of the host&#8217;s network throughput capacity that is utilized VMs per host &#8212; The number of VMs running on each host When charting datastores, you can show the following metrics: UI &#8212; The Utilization Index, a measure of the overall utilization of resources on the datastore Storage &#8212; The percentage of the storage capacity that is utilized IOPs &#8212; The percentage of the capacity for read and write IO operations per second that is utilized Latency &#8212; The percentage of latency capacity that is utilized, measured in ms To see precise utilization values, hover over a data point to display a tooltip. Displaying the Utilization Comparison Chart In the Projected Improvements chart, you can click the Details icon to open a Utilization Comparison chart for your environment. This chart is the same as the view you get in the Optimize view, minus the navigation panel. For information about this view, see The Optimize View . Optimal Operating Zone This chart projects how your environment can change over time from the current state to a state within the optimal operating zone (see The Optimal Operating Zone ). You can view projections for Memory and CPU utilization, aggregated for all the hosts in your environment. The chart shows the historical data that it uses to make the projection. You can drag the Time sliders to set dates for the historical data. The chart then projects the values for maximum, minimum, and average forward into a period of one week. This projection assumes you have accepted the actions in the To Do list. You should see a the average trend toward the center of the optimal operating zone. The Max and Min values should trend toward the same point, indicating that the size of the operating zone is shrinking to within an acceptable range of deviations from the average.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Configuring Aggregation	Configuring Aggregation By default, each instance of Operations Manager is configured to run stand-alone. To set up aggregation, you separately configure each target instance and the aggregating instance. The basic steps you will follow to configure aggregation are: Install the Operations Manager instances that you want for this environment Gather the information about each installation that you will need for configuration You should take note of the following information: The IP address or DNS name of the planned aggregating instance The IP address or DNS name of each planned target instance A unique ID for the aggregating instance This can be any string that you use to identify the instance. However, you should use a name that is both unique and meaningful to you. A unique ID for each target instance This can be any string that you use to identify the instance. However, you should use a name that is both unique and meaningful to you. For each instance, edit the appliance&#8217;s configuration file Restart the instances For each target instance, assign the hypervisors or other target servers that it will monitor. For more information about assigning these targets, see Target Configuration . NOTE: The aggregating instance requires the Cloud Edition license, and target instances require either Enterprise Edition or Cloud Edition licenses. It is also very important that you provide static IP addresses for target instances. The aggregating configuration file uses IP addresses to identify the target instances of Operations Manager. Dynamic IPs might change, which would render the configuration invalid. Login and Config File Access To configure the aggregating instance and each target instance, use SSH or the console to log into the Operations Manager appliance with the following credentials: User: root Password (default): vmturbo After you log onto an Operations Manager appliance, edit the following file: srv/tomcat6/data/config/appliances.config.topology As you configure each instance, you will comment out certain sections, then uncomment and edit others. When you first open it, the file should be similar to the following: &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ASCII&quot;?&gt; &lt;PresentationLayer:ServiceProxyManager xmi:version=&quot;2.0&quot; xmlns:xmi=&quot;http://www.omg.org/XMI&quot; xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; xmlns:Foundation=&quot;http:///com/vmturbo/platform/VMTRoot.ecore/OperationalEntities/Foundation&quot; xmlns:Mediation=&quot;http:///com/vmturbo/platform/VMTRoot.ecore/OperationalEntities/Mediation&quot; xmlns:PresentationLayer=&quot;http:///com/vmturbo/platform/VMTRoot.ecore/OperationalEntities/PresentationLayer&quot; numThreads=&quot;5&quot; id=&quot;StandAlone&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- NOTE: Provide a unique id value above when configuring an aggregator or an aggregation target appliance --&gt; &lt;!-- DEFAULT LOCAL APPLIANCE: Comment this out to configure this appliance as an aggregator --&gt; &lt;appliances xsi:type=&quot;Foundation:VMTLocalAppliance&quot; nameOrAddress=&quot;localhost&quot;/&gt; &lt;!-- TARGET APPLIANCE: Declares the aggregator for this target.

Before configuring a target instance, be sure it is running with the Enterprise Edition or Cloud Edition license. You cannot configure a Community Edition version of Operations Manager as an aggregation target. Log into the appliance and access the configuration file (see Login and Config File Access ). To configure a target: 1. Open the appliance configuration file in a text editor. Open the file, srv/tomcat6/data/config/appliances.config.topology . 2. Provide a unique ID for the target instance. Find the string id=&quot;StandAlone&quot;&gt; , and change it to be the ID you want for this target. The result should be similar to id=&quot;MyTarget1&quot;&gt; . (You should have already decided on the ID to use. See the first steps in Configuring Aggregation for a list of information you should already have.) Note that it is often helpful to provide the IP address or DNS name in the ID &#8212; For example id=&quot;MyTarget_10.10.123.45&quot; . 3. Ensure the Local Appliance declaration is not commented out. Find the line that begins &lt;!-- DEFAULT LOCAL APPLIANCE: If necessary, uncomment the &lt;appliances .../&gt; element beneath this line (delete the &lt;!-- and --&gt; characters surrounding the element) 4. OPTIONAL: Define the aggregating instance that will be a master to this target. This step is optional because Operations Manager doesn&#8217;t currently use this information. However, future versions might require this step. Find the line that begins &lt;!-- TARGET APPLIANCE: Uncomment the &lt;appliances .../&gt; element beneath this line (delete the &lt;!-- and --&gt; characters surrounding the element) In this element, provide the aggregating instance&#8217;s IP or DNS for the nameOrAddress attribute Provide the aggregation instance unique ID for the id attribute 5. Comment out the Aggregating Appliance declaration. Ensure this section is commented out. Find the line that begins &lt;!-- AGGREGATING APPLIANCE: Comment out the &lt;appliances .../&gt; element beneath this line (add &lt;!-- and --&gt; characters to surround the element) 6. Save the configuration file and restart the instance. At the command line for this appliance, issue the following command: service tomcat6 restart You can now proceed to configure this Operations Manager instance with target servers (hypervisors, load balancers, etc.).For more information about assigning these targets, see Target Configuration . NOTE: Each target instance of Operations Manager must be configured to manage unique target servers. For example, assume a hypervisor at 123.123.456.789. You must assign this hypervisor as a target to only one Operations Manager instance in your group of aggregated Operations Manager appliances. This is to ensure the aggregating appliance does not display duplicate information. Aggregating Instance Configuration Before configuring an aggregating instance, be sure it is running with the Cloud Edition license. You cannot configure a Community Edition or Enterprise Edition version of Operations Manager as an aggregating instance. Log onto the appliance and access the configuration file (see Login and Config File Access ). NOTE: When setting up an aggregating instance of Operations Manager, you should always use a new installation. Do not re-use an existing Operations Manager installation that has been set up as a standalone or target appliance. To configure the aggregating instance: 1. Open the appliance configuration file in a text editor. Open the file, srv/tomcat6/data/config/appliances.config.topology . 2. Provide a unique ID for the aggregating instance. Find the string id=&quot;StandAlone&quot;&gt; , and change it to be the ID you want for this target. The result should be similar to id-&quot;MyAggregator&quot;&gt; . Note that it is often helpful to provide the IP address or DNS name in the ID &#8212; For example id=&quot;MyAggregator 10.10.123.456&quot; . 3. Comment out the Local Appliance declaration. Ensure this section is commented out. Find the line that begins &lt;!-- DEFAULT LOCAL APPLIANCE: Comment out the &lt;appliances .../&gt; element beneath this line (add &lt;!-- and --&gt; characters to surround the element) 4. Comment out the Target Appliance declaration. Ensure this section is commented out. Find the line that begins &lt;!-- TARGET APPLIANCE: Comment out the &lt;appliances .../&gt; element beneath this line (add &lt;!-- and --&gt; characters to surround the element) 5. Define the instances that will be targets for this aggregating instance. Note that you can specify any number of target instances. You must have one appliances declaration for each target instance in your architecture. Find the line that begins &lt;!-- AGGREGATING APPLIANCE: Uncomment the &lt;appliances .../&gt; elements beneath this line (delete the &lt;!-- and --&gt; characters surrounding the elements) In each appliances element, provide the target instance&#8217;s IP or DNS for the nameOrAddress attribute Provide the target instance unique ID for the id attribute Be sure to properly close each new &lt;appliances&gt; element with a matching &lt;/appliances&gt; close tag 6. Save the configuration file and restart the instance. At the command line for this appliance, issue the following command: service tomcat6 restart After you restart the instance, the GUI should display combined data from the target instances.

Creating_and_Editing_Templates.html	Creating_and_Editing_Templates.html	157239	10	4015	Creating and Editing Templates To deploy VMs, you select a VM...	VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Creating and Editing Templates	Creating and Editing Templates To deploy VMs, you select a VM Template to specify desired resources for the VM, and a Deployment Profile to specify deployment details such as the source VM package (the OVF or VHD files) and optional placement constraints. Operations Manager creates a number of VM Templates automatically as it discovers source VM data on the target hypervisors. These templates are read-only; you cannot edit them because they reflect data that is specified in target hypervisor. Operations Manager also discovers associated Deployment Profiles that correspond with the discovered templates (also read-only). You can create your own VM Templates and Deployment Profiles, and use them to deploy VMs. In this way, you can plan for and deploy VMs with different configurations than any VMs currently defined in your environment. Operations Manager users can edit these templates if they have privileges to use the Deploy view. This following sections describe: Creating VM Templates Creating Deployment Profiles Discovered Deployment Data Creating VM Templates VM Templates describe the resource allocation that you want to provide for a class of VMs. When deploying VMs, Operations Manager uses the values that are specified in a chosen VM template. Before creating the template, you should plan allocation of the following resources: VCPUs The virtual CPUs assigned to the VM. Virtual Memory The memory size for the VM, in MB. Note that you should never allocate less than is required for the guest OS. Storage The amount of disk storage assigned to the VM, in GB. Network Throughput Used The amount of the host&#8217;s network throughput to assign to the VM, in MB/s. IOPs The input operations per second allocated to the VM. IO Throughput Used The amount of the throughput on the host&#8217;s IO bus to assign to the VM, in MB/s. The values you set for these resources determine the configuration of any VMs you deploy using this template. To create a VM Template: 1. Click the Create/Edit icon ( ) to open the dialog box. 2. In the dialog box, click the Add icon for the VM Templates list. To edit an existing template, select the template and click the Edit icon. Note that you can only edit user-created templates. 3. In the fields that appear, enter settings for the VM Template. The Template Name and Vendor fields help identify the template for future use. 4. Click Apply when you&#8217;re done. Creating Deployment Profiles A Deployment Profile specifies the physical files that will be copied to deploy the VM, as well as optional placement limitations. NOTE: In many cases it&#8217;s best to simply let Operations Manager choose where to place the VMs you deploy. However, if you want to limit deployment to a specific datacenter or cluster, you can use a Deployment Profile to specify these constraints. If you are creating a profile for VMs in a Hyper-V environment, you should always select a Hyper-V datacenter or cluster for the profile. Before creating the profile, you should know: The path to the VM package files (OVF or VHD) that will be copied to create the VM Optionally, the name of the datacenter or cluster that you want to deploy the VMs to To create a Deployment Profile: 1. Click the Create/Edit icon ( ) to open the dialog box. 2. In the dialog box, click the Add icon for the Deployment Profiles list. 3. In the fields that appear, provide the settings for the Deployment Profile. 4. Click Apply when you&#8217;re done. Discovered Deployment Data Many hypervisor technologies support the use of source VMs as files that can be cloned, and the clones can be deployed as running VMs. For example, XenServer and CloudStack require the use of such source VMs to deploy new running VMs in their environments. When it performs discovery, Operations Manager identifies the source VM data on each hypervisor, and builds a corresponding set of VM Templates and Deployment Profiles. NOTE: Hyper-V targets do not include discovered VM Templates and Deployment Profiles. You must create these files to deploy VMs in a Hyper-V environment. In the Deployment Profile, you must specify a Hyper-V datacenter. For discovered VM Templates and Deployment Profiles, Operations Manager uses the following naming conventions: VM Template &#8212; These names begin with the IP address of the hypervisor that stores them Deployment Profile &#8212; These names begin with the characters DEP- for &#8220;Deployment&#8221;, and if they match a discovered template, the profile name mirrors the template&#8217;s name To view the settings for a discovered template or profile, open the template editor and select the item you want to inspect. The editor shows the template or profile in a dimmed view. You cannot edit a discovered VM Template or Deployment Profile. This is to preserve the integrity of the template and profile in relation to the source VM data.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Creating Plans	Creating Plans A plan defines the workload, resources, and rules that you want to use when calculating results. You can think of a plan as a description of your desired environment. Operations Manager then calculates the results that can come from the planned changes. NOTE: When you create a new and untitled plan, it is a description of your current environment. You can run the Planner against such a plan, and it will give you results for your current environment. For example, to check the workload distribution of your current environment you can simply run a new and untitled plan. To create a plan, you specify its properties and then save it.

The settings you can make are different, depending on the type of item the template is for. Template Settings for VMs These settings identify a VM type, and specify the resources that VM type will consume. For VCPU, Operations Manager assigns 75% of the physical CPU resources to the VM. For example, if you specify 1 VCPU for this VM type, Operations Manager assigns 75% capacity of a CPU on the machine that hosts the VM. This ensures that the host machine has CPU capacity to perform infrastructure tasks. For VMEM and VStorage, Operations Manager assigns 100% of the physical resources that you specify here. Template Settings for PMs These settings identify a PM type, and specify the resources it can provide.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Custom Branding of Operations Manager	Custom Branding of Operations Manager Third-party distributors and service providers might want to customize the company brand name for Operations Manager. You can change the logos that appear in generated reports and in the GUI, so the product will present your brand&#8217;s logo. When you re-brand Operations Manager: You create one or more custom Operations Manager startup pages to display custom logos The product GUI displays your logo Generated reports display your logo, and your copyright statement To re-brand the product, you will upload a ZIP archive that contains custom html files, and a set of logo image files. Operations Manager then copies the files into the proper locations. In addition, the Operations Manager installation stores a copy of your re-branding files so that your brand will remain even after executing a product update. Re-Branding Operations Manager To re-brand Operations Manager: 1. Create image files for your logos and copyright statement. Create the following files: logo-&lt;Brand_Name&gt;.jpg logo.jpg (where &lt;BrandName&gt; is a custom name you use to identify your brand) Used in the top-left of the application window. This image file must be 29 pixels high by 150 pixels wide. User interface display will have unpredictable results if you use a different sized image. VMTurbo.jpg Used in the Reports web page. The recommended size for this image is 31 pixels high by 250 pixels wide. vmt_logo.jpg Used in the Reports web page. The recommended size for this image is 31 pixels high by 250 pixels wide. logo.jpg Used in the headers of generated report pages. This image file must be 29 pixels high by 150 pixels wide. copyright.jpg Used to declare your copyright for generated reports. The recommended size for this image is 18 pixels high by 15 pixels wide. The image appears at the bottom-right of report pages. 2. Download the default re-branding package. You will use this package as a template for creating your own re-branding package. Navigate to HTTP://&lt;appliance_IP&gt;/update.html . Provide a username/password for an administrator account, choose Download Existing Branding, then click Download . This downloads the file branding.zip . Save this file in your working directory. You should change the file name &#8212; for example, save it as branding_default.zip . NOTE: You get the default package only from an Operations Manager instance that has not already been re-branded. Be sure to save this default package for future reference. 3. Unzip the re-branding package and add your images to the file tree. You should see the following directory structure &#8212; add your files as indicated below in bold text: ...\MyWorkingDir\srv ...\MyWorkingDir\srv\rails ...\MyWorkingDir\srv\rails\webapps ...\MyWorkingDir\srv\rails\webapps\persistence ...\MyWorkingDir\srv\rails\webapps\persistence\public ...\MyWorkingDir\srv\rails\webapps\persistence\public\images ...\MyWorkingDir\srv\rails\webapps\persistence\public\images\ vmt_logo.jpg ...\MyWorkingDir\srv\rails\webapps\persistence\public\images\ VMTurbo.jpg ...\MyWorkingDir\srv\reports ...\MyWorkingDir\srv\reports\images ...\MyWorkingDir\srv\reports\images\ copyright.jpg ...\MyWorkingDir\srv\reports\images\ logo.jpg ...\MyWorkingDir\srv\www ...\MyWorkingDir\srv\www\htdocs ...\MyWorkingDir\srv\www\htdocs\com.vmturbo.UI ...\MyWorkingDir\srv\www\htdocs\com.vmturbo.UI\assets ...\MyWorkingDir\srv\www\htdocs\com.vmturbo.UI\assets\images ...\MyWorkingDir\srv\www\htdocs\com.vmturbo.UI\assets\images\ logo-&lt;BrandName&gt;.jpg ...\MyWorkingDir\srv\www\htdocs\com.vmturbo.UI\UIMain.html 4. Rename the UIMain.html file This file presents the Operations Manager user interface, along with the branding logo. When your users launch your GUI, the URL they execute will terminate in this filename. For that reason, you should give a filename that represents your brand. For example, if you rename the file to UIMain_MyCompany.html , the URL customers execute will be HTTP://&lt;Appliance_Address&gt;/com.vmturbo.UI/UIMain_MyCompany.html . Note that you can make several copies of this file, each with a different name, and each that will use a different logo. In that case, you would: Create different versions of logo-&lt;BrandName&gt;.jpg , and store them all in ...srv\www\htdocs\com.vmturbo.UI\assets\images\ Give different customers the appropriate URLs, depending on which of these UIMain.html files you want them to open 5. Edit the UIMain.html title element Edit this file to set the text that displays in the browser window&#8217;s title bar. Search for the &lt;title&gt; element, and make your changes. For example, change &lt;title&gt;VMTurbo - Observe.Advise.Automate&lt;/title&gt; to &lt;title&gt;MyComppany - Observe.Advise.Automate&lt;/title&gt; 6. Specify the logo for this UIMain.html file The logo is specified as a Flash variable. Search the file for the following statement: var flashvars = {}; Immediately after this line, specify the path to your custom logo as follows: flashvars.appImageFileName = &quot;assets/images/logo-&lt;BrandName&gt;.jpg&quot;; Assuming a logo file named logo-MyCompany.jpg, the resulting edit should appear as follows: var flashvars = {}; flashvars.appImageFileName = &quot;assets/images/logo-MyCompany.jpg&quot;; 7. Save the file tree as a re-branding package The re-branding file tree that you have modified begins at the srv directory. Save this directory and all of its contents as a ZIP file named branding.zip . 8. Upload your custom re-branding package Navigate to HTTP://&lt;appliance_IP&gt;/update.html and choose Upload New Branding Provide a username/password for an administrator account Click Browse and select the ZIP file you just created Note: The file must be named branding.zip . Click Upload This uploads the package to the installation. Operations Manager deploys these files so it can use the logos and copyright image that you provided. In addition, it stores the package so your brand will persist after you update to later versions of Operations Manager. 9. Save your branding packages for later reference. You should save the default branding package and your custom branding package, in case you need either of the sets of files at a later date. Delivering the Re-Branded GUI To deliver your branded GUI to your customers, have them execute the URL that calls your custom version of UIMain.html . For example, have your customers navigate to: HTTP://&lt;Appliance_Address&gt;/com.vmturbo.UI/UIMain_MyCompany.html Updating Operations Manager When you update Operations Manager, the updated version will still use your custom branding. In some cases, an update includes changes to the UIMain.html file. In this case, your customized file will not include these changes. For your custom brand to use the latest changes in UIMain.html, you must recreate your custom UIMain.html files, based on the new version.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Defining Replace Parameters	Defining Replace Parameters To plan hardware replacement, you must specify which hardware you will replace, and what you will replace it with. When you create the plan scenario, you can make the same settings that you make for any other plan. For example, you can set the baseline to past conditions, or you can add more VMs to the workload. For more information, see Creating Plans . The following sections describe settings you make that are special for hardware replacement: Scope (You set scope for any plan, but the effect is slightly different for hardware replacement.) Hardware Type Template Hardware to be Replaced Scope Plan scope determines which devices in the environment will be affected by the plan. For example, if you set the scope to a cluster, then replacement planning will only affect the physical devices in that cluster. Note that you can set the scope to groups of VMs or to Virtual Data Centers. In this case, hardware replacement will affect only the physical machines that provide resources to these virtual entities. To set the current plan&#8217;s scope, click the Scope icon ( ). This opens the Define User Scope dialog box where you can navigate the inventory tree and set the plan scope. For more information, see Setting Plan Scope . Hardware Type Hardware Replace plans support Hosts and Data Stores. The type you choose determines which templates you can select, and which hardware you can replace. One plan scenario can be devoted to replacing hosts or storage, or you can define a single scenario that replaces both hosts and data stores. Template The template you choose describes the new hardware for your plan. Operations Manager ships with predefined templates, and you can create your own templates to describe specific hardware that you have in mind. To create a new template, select Add New Template , and then click Edit Template . Note that as you define your own templates, they are stored with Operations Manager installation, and are available to anybody else who uses the planner on the same installation. The templates you use here are also available when specifying workloads for a planning scenario. For more information, see Creating Templates . You can make the following settings in a template: User Information Template Name Vendor Description Price: Operations Manager uses this price to calculate replacement costs or savings Capacity Data: Values Operations Manager uses to calculate capacity and utilization CPU Cores and Speed Memory Network Throughput IO Throughput When you run a plan, Operations Manager uses the template&#8217;s pricing and capacity data to calculate the plan results. For example, if you replace your current hosts with less powerful models to address under utilization, Operations Manager will use the template to recalculate the optimal workload distribution. You might see that workload is more evenly distributed across the smaller machines, giving you a saving in actual cost. Hardware to be Replaced Once you have specified the plan scope, hardware type, and the template you want for the scenario, you can specify which hardware you will target for replacement. You can specify individual devices, or you can select groups of devices to replace. When you expand items in this dialog box, the physical devices you can select are limited by the scope you have set for this scenario. For example, assume you selected a cluster of VMs that are restricted to PMs in Cluster-1. In that case, then you browse for hosts to replace, you will only see the hosts in that cluster. After you select the hardware to replace, Operations Manager commits your parameters to the current scenario. The Plan Modification Log shows the replace actions you have specified for this scenario. Once you have made settings for Host, you can then add in settings to replace data stores as well. After you have made the settings you want, you can then run the plan, save it, or start a new plan to discard your changes.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Deploying VMs	Deploying VMs NOTE: An instance of Operations Manager can only support one deployment session at a time. The calculations to propose and to execute a deployment take a certain amount of time. While these processes are under way, Operations Manager will not allow you to begin a new deployment session. Any other users logged into the same Operations Manager instance will receive an error if they try to deploy VMs while these processes are under way. To deploy VMs, you will perform the following steps: 1. Provide a name for the VM or VMs. Provide a descriptive name so you can easily find these VMs in the inventory. 2. Choose the VM Template to use for the new VMs. VM Templates specify the resources available to the VM, including: VCPUs Virtual Memory Storage Network Throughput IOPs IO Throughput Choose the VM Template that specifies the resource allocation that you want for the VM. To inspect VM Templates, open the Edit Templates dialog box ( ), and select the template you&#8217;re interested in. (For more information about using this dialog box, see Creating VM Templates .) Note that if the VM Template was discovered, its name begins with the IP address of the hypervisor that manages that VM template data. Also, a discovered template is read-only (you cannot edit discovered templates). When you choose a VM Template, the Deployment Profiles list becomes active. 3. Specify how many VMs to deploy with this action. When you deploy more than one VM, Operations Manager appends a number to the VM name you provide (MyVM_0, MyVM_1, MyVM_2, etc.). 4. Choose the Deployment Profile to use as the basis of your new VMs. The Deployment Profile specifies physical details about how to deploy the VM, including: The path to the VM package files (OVF or VHD) that will be copied to deploy this VM Note that if the Deployment Profile data was discovered by Operations Manager, then the profile does not show a path to the VM package files. Optional placement constraints (constrain to datacenter or cluster) If the Deployment Profile does not specify a datacenter or cluster, then Operations Manager is free to deploy the VM anywhere in your virtual environment. To inspect Deployment Profiles, open the Edit Templates dialog box, and select the template you&#8217;re interested in. (For more information about using this dialog box, see Creating Deployment Profiles .) Note that if the Deployment Profile was discovered, its name begins with the characters DEP- for &#8220;Deployment&#8221;. A discovered profile is read-only (you cannot edit discovered Deployment Profiles). 5. Begin the deployment action &#8212; Operations Manager displays details for the VMs it will deploy. After you have made your choices, click Begin Deploy . Operations Manager starts to calculate the optimal placement for the VMs you have decided to deploy. Operations Manager does not deploy the VMs at this step. After it finishes the calculations, Operations Manager displays a list of proposed VM deployments, one for each VM that you specified. You may have to wait briefly while Operations Manager makes these calculations. 6. Review the proposed deployment, and commit the action. Be sure to review the deployment details list, and make sure you want to deploy these VMs. If you do not, you can cancel the operation now, before Operations Manager makes any changes to your environment. If you agree with the proposed VM deployment, click Commit to create the VMs. You may have to wait a few minutes while Operations Manager performs the deployment actions. When the deployment has finished, you can see a listing of the status for each deployed VM. If a deployment failed, the listing includes the reason for the failure. If for some reason you log out of Operations Manager, the deployment action completes anyway. When you log in again, Operations Manager displays an alert telling you that you logged out while a deployment was pending.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Email and Trap Notification	Email and Trap Notification You can set up email and SNMP trap notifications for problems that arise on VMs, hosts, or data stores. Operations Manager can send notifications when problems occur and when they&#8217;re cleared. For example, you can set up a notification to your email address whenever there&#8217;s a Discovery problem, or an SNMP trap to your network management application whenever there&#8217;s a monitoring problem. Message Format You can define the content of Email notification messages, as well as the From address for each message. To make these settings, select the Email / Trap Notifications category and make Global settings. The From address identifies the sender, and will be used for any replies to an email notification. If you leave this field blank, the From address will be the email address that is associated with the Operations Manager license installation. NOTE: The From address also identifies the sender for report subscriptions. For more information about report subscriptions, see Manage Subscriptions . When you define message content, you enter format variables and line breaks to determine what the massage will include. For example, the following message format: {6}: {5} &#92;nDatastores: {9}&#92;nTarget: {7}&#92;nEvent: {0} - {4}&#92;nCategory: {1}&#92;nSeverity: {2} Results in the following email message: PhysicalMachine: myMachine.corp.mydomain.com Datastores: No value Target: 10.10.172.203 Event: WorkloadBalance - Improve Physical Machine workload distribution for hp-esx28.corp.vmturbo.com Category: Workload Placement Severity: MINOR State: NOTIFY The message format variables for a message are: Variable Description {0} Event type - The problem name.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Examples of Risks and Actions	Examples of Risks and Actions Following are some types of the risks and efficiency opportunities Optimizer can identify, and actions it can recommend to optimize your system deployment. Critical Over-Utilization Whenever any system resource reaches critical utilization, your infrastructure can experience bottlenecks. Applications running on VMs that are hosted by critically over-utilized machines will show performance problems, and so your QOS may suffer. The resources that can be affected are: Memory CPU IO Network utilization CPU Ready Queues Data storage Possible Resolutions: Move VMs from the affected host to a host with less utilization. Operations Manager can perform this action automatically. Start or provision a new host machine. You must perform this action manually. Provision a new data store. You must perform this action manually. Low Utilization Under-utilization presents an opportunity to increase efficiency, because it results in higher costs to maintain excessive hardware. The resources that can be affected are: Memory CPU IO Network utilization CPU Ready Queues Possible Resolutions: Move VMs from an under-utilized host to another host. Operations Manager can perform this action automatically. Suspend the under-utilized host. Operations Manager can perform this action automatically. Mis-configured VMs Bottlenecks can arise when a VM is not configured with enough virtual processing power to support its applications. The resources that can be affected are: Number of VCPUs in a virtual machine Possible Resolutions: Reconfigure the affected VM. You must perform this action manually. Mis-configured Infrastructure Optimizer can identify general configuration problems in your infrastructure. These problems can result in poor QOS, even though none of the hosts show over-utilization problems. The resources that can be affected are configuration of: Network Cluster Storage Possible Resolutions: Reconfigure the affected infrastructure resource. You must perform these actions manually.

NOTE: The To Do List can show a large number of actions, many of which share the same source and destination. When performing actions, you should always click the Show Top radio button to limit the list of actions. These top-10 actions do not share the same source or destination, and it is safe to perform these actions all at once. You should not accept multiple actions that share the same source or destination, and execute them all at once with a single click of the RESOLVE button. You can execute actions in the following ways: Automatically Operations Manager performs the actions as it recommends them. You don&#8217;t need to do anything to perform these actions. Manually, through Operations Manager Operations Manager shows the actions in the To Do list, with active check boxes you can select. You select the actions to perform, and then click Resolve . Externally, outside of Operations Manager Operations Manager recommends the action, but cannot execute it. Either an Operations Manager policy specifies that the action cannot be executed, or there is no way for Operations Manager to direct the hypervisor to perform the action. For example, there is no way for Operations Manager add more memory to a physical machine. You execute these actions outside of Operations Manager. In addition, you can create policies that completely disable certain actions. In that case, Operations Manager never shows the action in the To Do list. You can specify action policies for VMs, hosts, storage devices, and cloud stacks. These policies determine how to execute each action. You can specify global policies for all entities of each type, and you can also specify policies for specific groups of entities. For more information, see Action Modes .

When using the Navigation Panel, or when or setting scope, you can select groups to focus on those specific resources. For example, if you have a number of VMs devoted to a single customer, you can create a group of just those VMs. When running a Planner scenario you can set the scope to work with just that group. Operations Manager ships with some groups already defined. With Group Management you can also create your own groups. Operations Manager supports two custom-grouping methods: By criteria &#8212; You create dynamic groups that are defined by specific search criteria. You can group services according to naming conventions (all VM names that start with &#8220;ny&#8221;), resource characteristics (all physical machines with four CPUs), or other criteria such as time zone or number of CPUs. These groups are dynamic because Operations Manager updates the group as conditions changes. By manual selection &#8212; You create static groups by selecting the specific group members.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Improve Overall Efficiency	Improve Overall Efficiency This dashboard shows you opportunities you can exploit to improve the operating efficiency of your environment. You can use this dashboard to see how to consolidate workloads and utilize underlying infrastructure more efficiently. The dashboard displays this information in the following panels: To Do List This panel displays actions you can execute to improve operational efficiency. You can toggle the panel between a To Do list and a list of current efficiency opportunities. (For a complete description of To Do panels, see To Do Lists - Maintaining QoS .) Virtual Machine and Storage This panel lists clusters of VMs that you can inspect to see how they consume storage resources. When you expand a VM cluster, the panel shows how many VMs are in the cluster, and how much storage is devoted to them. The panel also shows how many VMs are dormant (no application is active on the VM) and how many are powered off. In this way, you can see how much storage is held in reservation for unused VMs. Wasted Storage The Wasted Storage panel lists datastore clusters, showing the amount of wasted storage for each. In Operations Manager, wasted storage is any disk space devoted to files that are not required for operations of the devices or applications in your environment. For datastores that you have set aside to support VMs, wasted storage may indicate opportunities for you to free up disk space, and provide more disk capacity to running VMs and applications. NOTE: You can specify directories that Operations Manager will not consider when calculating wasted storage. For more information, see Storage Settings . Virtual Machine Efficiency This panel lists VM clusters, showing how they consume their available memory and CPU resources. Expand the cluster and the Memory or CPU resource to see the values. For each resource type, the table shows the following amounts.

Increasing_Virtual_Load_under_Existing_Constraints.html	Increasing_Virtual_Load_under_Existing_Constraints.html	157239	7	2292	Increasing Virtual Load under Existing Constraints Assume you want to determine...	VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Increasing Virtual Load under Existing Constraints	Increasing Virtual Load under Existing Constraints Assume you want to determine the load distribution if you add more VMs to your environment. To do this, you would create a Workload Distribution scenario that adds the new VMs, and then determines the best way to spread the increased load among your physical hosts and data stores. Your environment already has its physical systems assigned to clusters and resource pools. As you add VMs to the environment, you want to respect these constraints. When thinking about this scenario, imagine asking, &#8220;What would happen if I add ten VMs running Web servers, and ten VMs running database servers? How can I optimally deploy these VMs in my current environment?&#8221; To plan out the best way to add these VMs to your inventory, you create a Workload Distribution scenario that: Identifies how many VMs to add Uses an existing Web server VM as a model for your new Web server VMs Uses an existing database VM as a model for your new database VMs The following steps show how to create such a scenario in the Plan view: 1. Display the Workload Distribution tab in the Planner. 2. Choose New from the Plan popup menu. This clears the Planner so you can specify a new plan. 3. Edit the load for your plan. For this plan you will add 20 VMs to your environment. Click the Load icon ( ) to open the Edit Load dialog box Specify the properties of the VMs that you will add For this scenario, you will add copies of existing VMs to your load. Copying existing VMs is just one way to specify the properties of your new VMs. To add copies of a specific VM, expand the VM group and select the VM you want, then click ADD . In the following image, the dialog box is set up to add 10 copies of a VM named Fedora 2: Now select another VM to copy, and add 10 more VMs to your load Be sure to click ADD after you have selected the new VM to copy. Now that you have defined the new load, click Close and Run Alternatively, you can just click Close and make other settings before running the planner scenario. For example, to plan for a recurring peak load you can run the scenario against a load that occurred in the past. Or you can specify the scope of the scenario so that it will only run on a specific group of physical hosts. After making these other changes, you would then click Run to execute the plan. When Operations Manager is finished running the plan, verify that the process completed with success The Plan Details show the current status of the plan: After a successful run, you can review the results in the Plan view. To see the results, choose one of the following view categories from the View dropdown menu: Summary View Physical Machine Utilization View Storage Utilization View Physical Machine and Storage Detailed Utilization View Action Plan Copyright &copy; 2010 - 2013, VMTurbo All rights reserved	 				Summary_View.html#50601992_583487 Physical_Machine_Utilization_View.html#50601992_660679 Storage_Utilization_View.html#50601992_583688 Physical_Machine_and_Storage_Detailed_Utilization_View.html#50601992_584460 Action_Plan.html#50601992_660864

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Information Panels	Information Panels As you select a dashboard or an item in the navigation panel, you can see information about that item in panels to the right. These panels show different charts and listings of properties, depending on the item you select. The panels have standard controls you can use to modify their display (see Standard Panel Controls ). Summary Panels In the Inventory view, the Inventory tree begins with a Summary entry. When you select this entry, Operations Manager shows summary information about your environment. The information displays in Summary panels for Applications, VMs, Physical Machines, and Storage. The following figure shows a VM summary panel. Panels Showing the Virtual Machine Summary The summary panel displays a heatmap with colored cells to show utilization of resources, as well as the Utilization Index. By default, heatmaps only show the Utilization Index, but you can customize them to show other values (see Customize Heatmap ). To get more details about an item, click on the colored entry. The figure above shows the details panel for utilization on a cluster of virtual machines. Clicking a named entry in the Summary panel opens a new view for that named item. When you are finished with this view, discard it by clicking the view button&#8217;s close box. Utilization Charts When you select a named service or group in the Inventory tree, Operations Manager displays panels for that item. One of the panels is the Utilization Chart. This chart shows utilization percentage and utilization index for the selected item. If the item represents a group of resources, the panel displays a bar chart showing utilization values for each resource. To show utilization history of a single service, click the corresponding bar in the chart. NOTE: The default user interface shows up to one hour&#8217;s worth of data. You can install licenses to enable the display of more historical data. The following figure shows utilization for the data stores in the current environment. It also shows the latency of a single data store. You can hover over a data point to display its tooltip, or click the data point to display a chart. Panels Showing the Utilization Dashboard Panels In the Home view, you select the dashboard you want, and Operations Manager displays system data in the associated dashboard panels. These panels include a To Do list, various charts, and expanding tables. Device Charts Expanding Table Some dashboard charts include the option to choose which type of device to plot. Choose the type from the drop-down menu. Expanding Tables Expanding Table Some dashboard tables include items that expand to show more data. You can quickly browse to the item you want to inspect, then expand it to see more information. Often, you can click the main entry to open a window that shows charts and details for that item.

Infrastructure_Cost.html	Infrastructure_Cost.html	157239	6	2694	Infrastructure Cost Often you will have different classes of hardware to...	VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Infrastructure Cost	Infrastructure Cost Often you will have different classes of hardware to host your environment, where you wish to reserve more expensive hardware for critical use. For example, you might reserve more expensive hosts to run business-critical applications, and reserve lower-cost hardware for your development environment. In that case, you would want Operations Manager to place applications accordingly &#8212; critical applications on these higher-priced hosts, and development applications on the lower-cost machines. Assigning a Host Template to the Infrastructure Cost Policy With Infrastructure Cost policies, you create templates that approximate your different classes of machines, and then assign those templates to the policies. Operations Manager then discovers which machines best match these templates, and assigns the machines to associated groups. For example, if you create a Small, a Medium, and a Large host template, Operations Manager creates three groups &#8212; PMs_Small, PMs_Medium, and PMs_Large. It then assigns all the hosts in your environment to these groups, according to which template most closely describes each host. Creating an Infrastructure Cost Policy To create an Infrastructure Cost policy: 1. Choose the device type you want &#8212; Host or Storage. 2. Choose the templates you want to add to the policy. You can choose an existing template from the template catalog, or create a new one. 3. Edit the template. Specify the following: Template name and description Price You should specify a price that approximates your hardware cost as well as possible. Currently, this price displays in generated reports. In future versions of Operations Manager the price might be used for other calculations. Capacity Do your best to approximate the capacity for the class of hardware you&#8217;re describing. Operations Manager uses these values to decide which group to put each device into. If a machine doesn&#8217;t exactly match any templates in the policy, Operations Manager assigns the machine to the closest match possible. Add to Infrastructure Cost Policy Turn on this check box to add the template to the policy. For each template that you enable, Operations Manager creates an associated group. ( Note: If no machines match the given template, then the group will not appear in the GUI.) 4. Apply the changes. Click Apply to assign the template to the policy. Using the Infrastructure Cost Policy These policies assign hardware to groups. The groups appear in the By Cost folder. When you set scope to a dashboard or a Workload Placement policy, you can select these or other groups. Setting Scope to a Group by Cost You can use these groups with the following Operations Manager features: Dashboards in The Home View You can use Infrastructure Cost groups to set the scope of dashboards on the Home view. In this way, you can save custom dashboards that only show information about a specific class of hardware. For more information, see Viewing Standard Dashboards . Workload Placement With Workload Placement policies, you can ensure that certain VMs will always be placed on hardware of a certain class, or else you can specify that certain VMs never get placed on a class of hardware.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Introducing Operations Manager	Introducing Operations Manager Thank you for choosing VMTurbo Operations Manager, the premier solution for intelligent workload management of cloud and virtual environments. Operations Manager maintains your environment within the optimal operating zone &#8212;operating conditions that achieve the following conflicting goals at the same time: Assured application performance Prevent bottlenecks, provision physical resources, upsize VMs, prioritize workload. Efficient use of resources Consolidate workload, downsize VMs, prevent VM sprawl and dormant VMs. Keeping a virtual infrastructure within the optimal zone is not a simple problem. You have to consider many different resources, numerous control points for each device, and how devices and resources are used in relation to each other. As you add devices to your infrastructure, the factors for each decision increase exponentially. On top of that, the environment is constantly changing&#8212;to stay in the optimal zone, you are constantly trying to hit a moving target. To perform intelligent workload management, Operations Manager models the environment as a market made up of buyers and sellers . These buyers and sellers make up a supply chain that represents tiers of devices in your inventory. Operations Manager uses Virtual Currency to give a budget to buyers and assign cost to resources. This virtual currency assigns value across all tiers of your environment, making it possible to compare the cost of application transactions with the cost of space on a disk or physical space in a data center. The price that a seller charges for a resource changes according to the seller&#8217;s supply. As demand increases, prices increase. As prices increase, buyers and sellers react. Buyers are free to look for other sellers that offer a better price, and sellers can duplicate themselves (open new storefronts) to meet increasing demand. Operations Manager uses its Economic Scheduling Engine to analyze the market and make these decisions. The effect is an invisible hand that dynamically guides your IT infrastructure to the optimal use of resources. To get the most out of VMTurbo Operations Manager, you should understand how it models your environment, the kind of analysis it performs, and the optimal state it works to achieve.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Load Balancer Discovery	Load Balancer Discovery Load balancers use virtual applications (sometimes called vServers) to manage requests to a defined set of running applications. Virtual applications are divided by service type. Operations Manager discovers the service types that are defined for the load balancers in your environment. To define which applications Operations Manager associates with load balancer service types, you assign an application signature to each service type. The application signatures should identify applications that are currently bound to specific load balancers. (Application binding to load balancers is part of the load balancer configuration.) To assign signatures to a load balancer service type, you must first have defined appropriate signatures for the specific applications running in your environment. For information about defining application signatures, see Application Discovery . When you have the appropriate application signatures, you can then assign signatures to load balancer service types. 1. Choose Discovery &gt; Load Balancer in the Category list. A list of load balancers appears. These are the load balancers you set up as targets in the Admin view (see Adding Load Balancers as Targets ). 2. Assign application signatures to a load balancer&#8217;s service types. Expand the load balancer you want and select a service type.

The Inventory tree groups these according to the supply chain &#8212; Virtual Applications, Applications, Virtual Machines, Physical Machines, Storage, etc. The Groups tree displays the items in groups defined by Operations Manager, as well as other groups that you define. A tree branch for a given service (a named VM or named storage, for example) can include the following: Composed Of &#8212; The constituent parts that make up the service; for example, a physical machine might include four CPUs in the Composed Of list, but only show one Processor entry in the Commodities list. Consumes &#8212; The service providing commodities that the parent service consumes; for example, a VM consumes a Host and a data store Hosts &#8212; For a physical machine, the VMs hosted on that PM. For example, the following figure shows a selected virtual machine named vm-005b. This VM uses three CPUs on its host. One of those CPUs is selected, and the information panel shows the properties of that commodity.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Notifications Bar	Notifications Bar Operations Manager generates notifications to alert you when events occur that affect the operation of the Operations Manager server. For example, if a target hypervisor loses connectivity, or if other network problems occur, you need to troubleshoot the issue and resolve it so Operations Manager can continue to manage your workload. You can review these notifications to see whether such problems have occurred. NOTE: Do not confuse these notifications with recommended actions in the To Do list, or their associated risks and opportunities. The notifications described in this topic do not represent the health of your virtual environment. They pertain to the connectivity between your target hypervisors and Operations Manager, or to other operational details, such as whether your target hypervisors have the proper tools installed. The Operations Manager GUI displays a notifications bar at the bottom-right of the window. This bar lists the number of notifications that are currently active. It also displays the color of the most severe notification that is active. Notification Bar and Notification Log To display the notification log, click an icon in the notification bar.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Organization Virtual Datacenters	Organization Virtual Datacenters An Organization Virtual Datacenter (vDC) is a collection of resources that are available for external customers to manage through the cloud. It is an environment customers can use to store, deploy, and operate virtual systems. Synopsis Budget: An Organization vDC gains its budget as a function of its activity. The higher the utilization of the vDC, the more Operations Manager assumes the vDC is selling its services to a user. If utilization is high enough on an Organization vDC, Operations Manager can increase resources for the vDC. If utilization falls of, Operations Manager can reduce resource capacity, or ultimately terminate the vDC. Operations Manager can also resize VMs through the Organization vDC in response to changes in VM utilization. Provides: Physical resources to host virtual systems. Consumes: Provider vDC Discovered through: Operations Manager discovers vDCs through cloud stack managers such as vCloud Director (see Adding and Removing Target Virtual Management Servers ). Operations Manager displays Provider vDCs in the inventory as follows: Operation Virtual Datacenters While users can see some of the physical resources that support the organization vDC, organization-level users cannot modify these physical resources. Users of organization vDCs make changes to how the virtual devices are deployed in that environment, but the must ask administrators to add more physical resources to the organization vDC. Likewise, Operations Manager can change VMs running in the vDC, but it does not make any changes to physical resources through this vDC.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: P2V &#8212; Planning Migration from Physical to Virtual	P2V &#8212; Planning Migration from Physical to Virtual To migrate your physical environment to a virtual environment, you will identify how many virtual machines to deploy, and what hardware you need to serve the virtual environment. You can perform your own analysis to build up such a listing, or you can use existing services and utilities to generate a listing. Once you have a list of the devices you need in your environment, you can use Operations Manager to plan out the distribution of workload and resources that will give you optimal performance. The Planner suggests deployments that assure QoS while making sure to utilize system resources as fully and efficiently as possible. When you execute P2V, the planner creates a planning scenario that contains only the devices in your listing. It then uses the Economic Scheduling Engine to calculate the best placement of VMs among the physical hosts and datastores. The Planner generates a To Do list of recommended actions to achieve this target deployment. When it&#8217;s completed, you can view the results: As an XML listing of recommended actions As a PDF report As a plan in the Plan view of Operations Manager Running a P2V Plan To run a P2V plan: 1. Generate a CSV listing of virtual and physical devices You can generate the listing in a number of ways. You can turn to a vendor to analyze your current physical environment and generate a listing for you. Or you can perform your own analysis to generate the listing. Once you have a list of physical and virtual devices, plus their capacities and resource requirements, you must convert that data into a CSV file with the appropriate fields for each device. For a listing of the required fields and field order, see CSV Field Order . 2. Load the listing and run the plan To access P2V planning, navigate your browser to the following URL: &lt; Operations Manager Address&gt;/plan.html This opens the P2V page where you can provide the following: The login credentials you give must be for a user account with a role that has access to run the Planner.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Physical Machines	Physical Machines A physical machine (PM or host) is a server that runs a hypervisor process. This means the PM can host VMs that are managed by the given hypervisor. Note that a PM is not necessarily a physical box, or computing iron. A VM can be set up as a server that runs a hypervisor, and it can in turn host other VMs within its processing space. However, it&#8217;s most usual to use iron as your PMs. Synopsis Budget: A PM gains its budget by selling resources to the VMs it hosts. The more VMs running on a PM, the more budget the PM has to purchase storage and datacenter resources. If utilization of a PM is high enough, Operations Manager can recommend that you provision a new PM. If utilization falls off, the PM loses budget. Ultimately, if the budget isn&#8217;t enough to pay for the services it consumes, Operations Manager will suspend or power off the PM. Provides: Host resources for VMs to use: Mem (Kbytes) CPU (MHz) IO (throughput on the I/O bus) Net (network throughput) Swap (swap rate capacity measured in bytes/sec) Ballooning (sharing of memory among hosted VMs) CPU Ready Queue (wait time on the queue in ms) Consumes: Datacenter resources (physical space, cooling, etc.) and storage. Discovered through: Operations Manager discovers PMs through hypervisor targets (see Adding and Removing Target Virtual Management Servers ). For some hypervisor vendors, the PM is the target, and for others the PMs are managed by the specified target.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Policy Scope	Policy Scope Policy scope determines which resources will be affected by the settings you make. Scope can be either: Global Settings : Base settings for each category that apply by default to all resources Group Overrides : Settings you apply to specific groups of resources Global Settings To make global settings, select a category, and if necessary select a resource type. The following image shows global settings for actions on Hosts. Global Policy Settings These are the base settings for all the resources in your inventory. The settings you make on groups and individual resources will override these global settings. Group Overrides You can make settings to groups of resources that override the global settings for the resource type. (For information about defining custom groups, see Group Management .) As you make these settings, you should be aware of issues that can arise with: Conflicting Settings Top-level Groups Conflicting Settings You can set overrides on any groups listed in the Profiles view. However, it&#8217;s possible that individual machines or applications are in more than one group (see the following illustration). Same VM in Two Groups In this case, you could set different overrides for the two groups, which can then conflict with each other in the same resource instance. For example, assume the following settings for VM Resizing : The Global setting is Manual The override for VMs_Beta\Cluster-1 (in Virtual Machines by Cluster) is Automated The override for VMs_dv VM Network (in Virtual Machines by Network) is Recommend In this case, two different settings will be associated with the VM named Fedora 12. In all such conflicts, Operations Manager uses a tie-breaker to resolves the conflict. In the case of actions, the tie-breaker uses the most conservative setting. Following this example, any Resize actions for Fedora 12 will be of type Recommend , because that is the most conservative of the settings for this VM. The documentation for each policy category describes the tie-breaker for that category. NOTE: Tie-breakers only apply among override settings. For example, even if a global action setting is more conservative than its override, the override takes precedence. But among two or more overrides for the same setting, the tie-breaker comes into effect. You can navigate to any instance in the scope tree, see its effective setting, and also see where that has been set. For example, the following figure shows that the action mode for Resize on Fedora 12 is Recommend , and it was set in the VMs_dv VM Network group. Viewing the Effective Setting for a VM Top-level Groups Within each policy category, the editor displays resources in groups. The following figure shows groups for actions on VMs. Top-level Groups for Actions Notice that each category has top-level groups. For example, the Action category sets policies for actions on VMs, hosts, datastores, and virtual datacenters. For VM actions the scope tree shows: Virtual Machines Virtual Machines by Cluster Virtual Machines by Network Virtual Machines by Storage Each of these is a top-level group. Beneath each top level you can see the individual groups that contain the resources. It&#8217;s likely that most individual resources belong to all of the top-level groups. For example, it&#8217;s likely that a single VM belongs to Virtual Machines by Cluster and to Virtual Machines by Datacenter You should not make settings to the top-level groups. You could make a top-level setting that always wins a tie-breaker, and so all the lower-level settings would never take effect. If you set overrides to a top-level group after lower-level settings were already made, you could inadvertently make all the lower-level settings ineffective. NOTE: If you want to make settings to all resources (all PMs or all VMs, for example), then you should make global settings (see Global Settings ). You should not make settings in a top-level group.

Project_Cluster_Resources.html	Project_Cluster_Resources.html	157239	10	4331	Project Cluster Resources This dashboard projects your future needs for VMs,...	VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Project Cluster Resources	Project Cluster Resources This dashboard projects your future needs for VMs, hosts, and datastores. With it you can see when and where you will you need additional resources to satisfy growing workload demand. The dashboard starts from the current state of your environment and: Shows the deployment you would achieve if you accepted the recommended actions in the Operations Manager To Do list Projects your needs into the future, assuming you maintain system health by continually executing recommended actions Updates its projections daily to respond to changing patterns of workload requirements To make these projections, Operations Manager adds the projected number of VMs to a hypothetical environment for the given projection period. It then runs Workload Projection planning scenarios for the given clusters on your environment, without taking constraints into account (see Workload Projection ). The dashboard shows a series of projections for: Now One month Two months Three months Six months One year NOTE: When you first install and start up Operations Manager, it builds up the list of cluster projections daily. By default, it runs a year&#8217;s worth of projections for two clusters each day. So if you environment has ten clusters, you will see a full set of cluster projections after five days of operation. The projections are based on past behavior, as follows: For the first-month projection, it uses 30 days of historical data For the second-month projection, it uses 60 days of data For the 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month projections, it uses 90 days of historical data The reliability of a projection depends on the amount of historical data it can use to establish a curve and extrapolate. For example, a 12 month projection based on two weeks of data is not as reliable as 12 months based on 90 days of historical data. If the system has not been running long enough to accumulate 60 days of data, Operations Manager uses the available data to generate projections as follows: For this much data Generated projections: Less than 30 days Months 1 and2 Less than 60 days Months 1, 2, and 3 Greater than 60 days Months 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 The projections use this historical data to investigate how workload has been added in the past, and projects the anticipated workload in the future. For example: For the first-month projection, it looks at how many VMs were added in the month previous, and are still present in your environment. For example, if you added 6 VMs last month, and one has been removed, then the 1-month projection adds another five VMs. For the second-month projection, Operations Manager uses two months of history in a similar way. For example, if you added eight VMs two months ago, and five of those are still in your environment, then the projection assumes 10 VMs &#8212; five for two months ago, and five for last month. For the third-month projection, the calculations are the same, only using three months of data. For the 6-, 9-and 12-month projections, Operations Manager uses the three-month calculation, and multiplies it by 2, 3, and 4, respectively. For example, as workload changes and you add more VMs to your environment, the projections assume a similar rate of growth. If growth continues at that rate, the projections show when you will need to add new physical resources to support growing demand. The dashboard displays the following panels: Cluster Summary This panel lists the current state of the VM clusters in your environment. You can use this panel to see details about the current deployment of VMs, hosts, and datastores. You can expand a cluster entry to see the counts for VMs, hosts, and datastores into the future. NOTE: This release of Operations Manager does not support the projection of totals for datastores. If you expand the Total item, the Datastores entry shows NA for each projection data. As you select a cluster in this panel, the other dashboard panels update to show data for that cluster. In this way you can see how each cluster will change into the future. To see projection data for the full environment, select the Total item. Cluster Projection Chart This chart shows a projection of total memory and CPU usage, based on the historical performance of your environment. When you select an item in the Cluster Summary panel, this chart updates to show the associated projection data. Provisioning Projections These charts show how your requirements for VMs, hosts, and datastores will change into the future. The green horizontal line indicates the number of devices you have in the environment today. The bars show the projected number of devices you will need into the future, with blue bars for projections within the current capacity, and red bars for projections that exceed the current capacity. Note that while the projections for physical machines and datastores are below current capacity, you can probably save money by consolidating your VMs on fewer physical devices. When projections exceed capacity, the charts indicate when you will need to invest in more hardware resources. In the above example, the dashboard projects that you will not need to add storage in the next year. However, it appears that you will need eight physical machines before the year&#8217;s end.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Provider Virtual Datacenters	Provider Virtual Datacenters A provider virtual datacenter (vDC) is a collection of physical resources (PMs and datastores) managed by a cloud stack. The cloud administrator has access to these resources, and defines the datacenter members. Usually a provider vDC is created to manage resources that will be exposed to external customers through one or more organizational vDCs. Synopsis Budget: A Provider vDC gains its budget by selling resources to the Organization vDCs that it hosts. If utilization falls off, the datacenter loses budget. Ultimately, if the budget isn&#8217;t enough to pay for the services it consumes, Operations Manager will terminate the Provider vDC. Provides: Physical resources such as PMs and datastores. Consumes: PMs and datastores Discovered through: Operations Manager discovers vDCs through cloud stack managers such as vCloud Director (see Adding and Removing Target Virtual Management Servers ).

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Reports	Reports Operations Manager reports give you selective snapshots of the state of your environment. Host reporting provides comprehensive customizable reports to track, analyze and trend your physical and virtual infrastructure operations. Storage reporting provides reports to track, analyze and trend the storage resources in your environment. The reporting utility includes a set of already defined reports, and you can design your own custom reports. Standard reports are in PDF format, and you can also export XML versions to view as Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. Operations Manager generates standard reports every day at a determined time (2:00 am on the Operations Manager system clock). With these reports you can see historical information about the state of your environment. NOTE: Operations Manager must run for at least 24 hours before the it can generate standard reports. You can view these reports in your web browser, or you can send them to a specified e-mail address. You can also add lists of subscribers to each report, including e-mail and reporting interval (daily or weekly). In this way, you can use Operations Manager reports to keep a specific group of people informed about the state of your environment. When you create custom reports, Operations Manager generates them per your request. These reports can display five-minute data, hourly data, or data that is consolidated daily. The Reports page displays a customized report as HTML &#8212; you can print it or save it as PDF, CSV, or XML. You can also send custom reports to a specified address and set up subscriptions. When you click the Reports tool ( ) or a report icon for an inventory item ( ), Operations Manager displays the reporting utility in a new web page.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Resource Descriptions	Resource Descriptions Operations Manager measures different resources in your environment. The following table lists these metrics, and includes details about how they are collected or measured For charts of clusters or groups of devices, charts show the average of the percentage of allocated resources that are used. Resource: Description: 1- 2- 4-CPU Rdy Wait time in the ready queue on the host, measured in ms. Charts show the percentage of time VM processes spend in a ready queue. For host charts, this is a measure of the total ready queue wait time for all the VMs running on that host. Balloon Ballooning capacity on the host, measured in Kbytes. Ballooning indicates the sharing of memory among the VMs on a given host. Charts show the percentage allocated ballooning capacity that is in use on the host. CPU Host CPU capacity, measured in Mhz. This shows what percentage of CPU cycles are devoted to processing instructions. Host charts show the percentage of the host&#8217;s CPU capacity that is in use. VM charts show the percentage of the host&#8217;s CPU capacity that is consumed by the given VM. IO Data rate through the host&#8217;s IO adapter, measured in KBytes/sec. Datacenter charts show the average percentage of the host IO capacity that is in use, for all the hosts in the datacenter. Host charts show the percentage of the host&#8217;s total IO capacity that is in use. IOPS Storage access operations per second. Charts show the percentage of allocated IOPS capacity that is used on a datastore. Latency Allocated capacity for latency on a datastore. This measures the latency experienced vy allVMs and hosts that access the datastore. Charts show the percentage of allocated latency that is in use on the datastore. Mem Host memory, measured in Kbytes. Host charts show the percentage of the host&#8217;s memory that is in use. VM charts show the percentage of the host&#8217;s memory that is consumed by the given VM. NET Data rate through the host&#8217;s Network adapter, measured in KBytes/sec. Datacenter charts show the average percentage of the host NET capacity that is used for all the hosts in the datacenter. Host charts show the percentage of the host&#8217;s total NET capacity that is in use. Storage Datastore capacity, measured in KBytes. Datastore charts show the percentage of a datastore&#8217;s capacity that is in use. Swap Allocated swap space on the host. Charts show the percentage of a host&#8217;s allocated swap space that is in use. Transactions Transactions per second in an application. Charts show the percentage of an application&#8217;s allocated transaction capacity that is in use. UI A measure of the risk to Quality of Service (QoS) that a consumer will experience. The higher the UI on a provider, the more risk to QoS for any consumer of that provider&#8217;s services. Charts show the UI for the given device. VCPU Virtual CPU capacity on a VM, measured in Mhz. Charts show the percentage of a VM&#8217;s VCPU cycles that are devoted to processing instructions. VMem Virtual memory allocated on a VM, measured in Kbytes. Charts show the percentage of a VM&#8217;s allocated VMem that is in use. Note that percentages of allocated VMem are measured against whichever is the less of: The VMem limit (if set) or the allocated VMem capacity. This is also true in reports and recommended actions. For example, assume a VM with allocated VMem of 8 GB, but a limit of 4 GB. In this case, the percentage in a chart shows the percentage utilized of 4GB. VStorage Virtual storage allocated on a VM, measured in Kbytes. Charts show the percentage of a VM&#8217;s allocated VStorage that is in use.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Running Plans	Running Plans The Planner uses plans to compare hypothetical conditions against the current conditions of your environment. You can modify a plan by setting conditions such as: Adding or removing VMs Using historical load conditions Respecting or ignoring constraints such as clusters or workload placement policies Adding hardware or restricting the plan to the current inventory NOTE: By default, a new and untitled plan mirrors your current environment. You can run the Planner against such a scenario, and it will give you results for your current environment. For example, to check the workload distribution of your current environment you simply run a new and untitled plan. The Planner can run scenarios to calculate three types of results: Workload Distribution The Planner calculates the configuration of your environment that will best distribute the planned load across your devices. You can run the plan with no modifications to distribute the current load on your environment, or you can create a plan that specifies a different load. For more information, see Workload Distribution . Workload Projection The Planner uses historical resource consumption data to calculate the future consumption you can expect under the plan&#8217;s conditions. Run a plan with no modifications to see how your current configuration will hold up into the future. Or you can run a projection with plan conditions that test how the environment would respond in the future to a different load. For more information, see Workload Projection . Hardware Replace Use templates for hosts or data stores to plan the effects you will see if you change the capacity of the physical devices in your environment. For more information, see Hardware Replace . By default, a plan incorporates all the constraints (cluster, storage, and network) and workload placement policies that are in effect. You can run a plan in two modes with respect to these constraints: Normal mode: The plan incorporates all the constraints. For example, in this mode the plan will not give resources from one cluster to a VM that is constrained to another cluster. Merge mode: The plan disables all the constraints before running. For example, in this mode the plan results can include: Moving VMs to hardware that is in a different cluster Moving VMs to hardware that uses different storage Changes that violate enabled workload placement policies When you run a plan, you can control whether the plan results assume you will add new hosts, or you will support the planned conditions with your current host inventory. Click the Enable Host Provisioning tool to enable or disable the addition of new hosts in your environment. NOTE: The results of running a plan are incremental &#8212; if you run the same plan twice, the summary compares the first plan&#8217;s results to the second plan&#8217;s target results. For example, assume you click Run to run a plan that respects all the constraints in your environment, and it suggests suspending a host &#8212; for example, from a current inventory of 15 hosts, to a target inventory of 14 hosts. The Summary panel will show a bar chart for 15 hosts in your current environment, compared to a target result with 14 hosts. Then if you click Merge and Run to disable constraints, the Summary panel will show a bar chart for 14 hosts in your current environment, compared to the new target results. To ensure clean results that are easy to understand, you should not run the same plan successively. Instead, you should load a new plan, or reload a saved plan before clicking Run or Merge and Run . For information about loading plans, see the procedure below, or see Managing Plan Files . To run a plan: 1. Display the plan type you want: Workload Distribution , Workload Projection, or Hardware Replace. 2. Either load a saved plan, or clear the current plan to create a new and untitled plan. To clear the plan, choose New . To load a plan, choose Open , and then pick the plan you want to load. 3. Click to decide whether to run without adding new hosts. This tool determines how the planner manages hosts. As it calculates the new workloads in the plan, Operations Manager can recommend that you add new hosts to support increased load. However, if you turn on this option, the planner results will not include the addition of any new hardware. Note: If you have specified a value for Target Utilization , you should not restrict to the current hardware. Otherwise, the plan results may not be satisfactory. 4. Make any special settings you need for the type of planning scenario you want to run. If you are running a Workload Projection , set the projection parameters.The projection parameters determine: The range of time for the projection&#8217;s base The projection will perform a linear interpolation based on historical workload data. As you set a time range, the dialog box charts the CPU and memory statistics for that range. Period: how far into the future to project the workload Using the base time range, the Planner will project the workload this far into the future. You can only set these parameters if you are in the Workload Projection tab. In this tab, the Utilization Chart includes controls to set the projection&#8217;s base and period. After you run the plan, this chart will show the projection data. For more information, see Workload Projection . If you are replacing hardware, set the scope of the hardware you will replace, and choose templates to describe the new hardware. For more information, see Hardware Replace . 5. Run the plan Run the plan in Normal or Merge mode. Note that Run icon changes to Stop ( ) while a plan is running. You can stop a running plan if necessary. After running a plan, you can review the results according to the type of plan you have run. For more information, see Workload Distribution and Workload Projection .

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Setting Plan Scope	Setting Plan Scope Plan scope determines which devices in the environment will be affected by the plan. For example, you can specify that a plan will only run on your Development cluster of PMs. In that case, the current environment for your plan would only include PMs in the Development cluster, the VMs hosted by those machines, and data stores that support those machines. Likewise, the target results would only correspond to those machines. Scope is determined differently if you select VMs or physical hosts: Scope by VM When you set scope by VMs, Operations Manager limits the plan to the physical hosts that those VMs are allowed to run on. Likewise, the plan includes all the data stores that are available to the VMs in your scope. Scope by PM When you set scope by PM, Operations Manager limits the plan to those physical hosts. For data stores, Operations Manager identifies all the VMs that can run on the hosts in your scope, and identifies all the data stores that are available for those VMs. NOTE: When setting scope for a plan, you can choose multiple groups. However, you should be sure to choose groups of the same type. For example, you should not scope by PM and VM groups for the same plan. To set the current plan&#8217;s scope, click the Scope icon ( ). This opens the Define User Scope dialog box. Ctrl-click to select multiple items in the list. When you click OK , Operations Manager sets that scope to the current plan. You can see the scope for the current plan in the Plan Details table.

The scope limits what the user can monitor. For example, assume you have created a group that contains only the physical machines that support this user&#8217;s VMs or applications. You can then set the user&#8217;s scope to that group. When the user logs in, Operations Manager will only display information about those machines, and resources associated with them such as hosted VMs and data storage that they use. In the figure below, the scope is set to a specific virtual datacenter. The user&#8217;s account can only access resources associated with that datacenter.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Show Top or Bottom Items in Chart	Show Top or Bottom Items in Chart For an environment with a large inventory, it&#8217;s not practical to chart every device in a single panel. For this reason, bar charts, data grids, and the To Do list are designed to show the top or bottom items in the given list, sorted by the values of a given commodity. For example, a summary chart of VMs can show the top 10 VMs, sorted by Usability Index (UI) or VMem consumption. For these charts, you can specify: Whether to show the top or bottom items What commodities to show in the chart Which commodity to sort by when showing the top or bottom items For charts that show multiple commodities per charted device (multiple bars for each VM, for example), you specify these settings in a Customize Chart dialog box. For charts that show only one commodity at a time, you make these settings directly on the chart. Sorting of Comparison Charts A number of charts in Operations Manager compare the current state of your environment with a target state.

This list shows live values that it gets from the database. For example, the list of values for the instance_name field shows the names of every entity that Operations Manager has discovered for your environment. Existing Field Values for Instance Name To see a list of values for a field, click the arrow next to that field. To use a value, you can copy it from the list and paste it in the Condition Value text field. For example, you could make a condition such as instance_name = datastore3 to limit your report to information about the entity named datastore3. This Field Value Reference does not show values for calculated fields. The following is a table of these fields, and how the values are treated: Field Name: Value Description utilization A percentage, where 0.5 = 50% stddev_property_value avg_property_value min_property_value max_property_value used_capacity available_capacity capacity A raw number, where the units of measure depend on the resource this field represents.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Specifying the Plan Workload	Specifying the Plan Workload The plan workload is determined by the set of VMs that are deployed in your environment, compared to the PMs and Data Stores that provide resources to them. The more VMs you have for a given number of PMs and data stores, the greater the load will be on these physical devices. With a plan you can add or remove VMs, PMs, and Data Stores to see what the target or projected results would be. For example, you can define a plan that adds VMs to the same set of PMs and Data Stores. Or you can upgrade your physical hosts so they have more CPU or memory resources, and see how that would affect the way your environment supports the current crop of VMs. To set the plan&#8217;s load, click the Edit Load icon ( ). The dialog box that appears displays a list of the load modifications you can specify. The dialog box gives you actions to perform on VMs, physical hosts, and data stores. The actions you can perform are similar for all three types; examples will show performing these actions for VMs. The actions you can perform are: Add Add one or more devices to the environment. Add Using Template Use a template to specify the properties of the devices you want to add. Replace Using Template Use a template to specify properties, and replace existing devices with these new devices. For example, use this to upgrade a physical host with more memory or CPU resources. Remove Select the devices you will remove. Change Resource Utilization (for VMs, only) Increase or decrease the load on selected VMs by a given percentage point. You can also create templates for add and remove operations. For more information, see Creating Templates . Add Select a device to serve as a model of what you want to add, then specify how many copies of that device you want to add to the environment. 1. Choose the Add action. 2. Navigate the list of items to choose which item to add. 3. Specify the number of copies to add, then click Add . The list of items will include folder called New Entities. You can expand that folder to see these items you have added. You can repeat these steps &#8212; select another item to copy, specify the number of copies, then click Add . New additions will appear in the New Entities folder. 4. When you have finished adding items to the plan&#8217;s load, close the dialog box. Click Close to close the dialog box. Use this option if you want to make more changes to the plan, or if you want to save the plan before you run it. Click Close and Run to close the dialog box and run the plan immediately. Add Using Template Select a template to serve as a model of what you want to add, then specify how many copies of that templated device you want to add to the environment. You can also choose to create a new template or edit an existing template (see Creating Templates ). 1. Choose the Add Using Template action. 2. Choose the template you want to use. Note that in the above example, the templates with IP addresses have been discovered on the indicated hypervisors. Templates without IP addresses in their names have been created by a user of Operations Manager. You can use either type of template in a plan. 3. Specify the number of copies to add, then click Add . The list of items will include folder called New Entities. You can expand that folder to see these items you have added. You can add other items, and this folder will update to show the new items. 4. When you have finished adding items to the plan&#8217;s load, close the dialog box. Click Close to close the dialog box. Use this option if you want to make more changes to the plan, or if you want to save the plan before you run it. Click Close and Run to close the dialog box and run the plan immediately. Replace Using Template Select the items you want to change, then select a template to serve as a model for what you will replace the devices with. You can also choose to create a new template or edit an existing template (see Creating Templates ). 1. Choose the Replace Using Template action. 2. Navigate the list of items to choose which items you will change. You can select individual items, or groups of items. 3. Choose the template you want to use. 4. Click Replace . The list of items will include folder called New Entities. You can expand that folder to see the replacement templates you have added to the plan. You can replace other items, and this folder will update to show the new items. 5. When you have finished replacing items to the plan&#8217;s load, close the dialog box. Click Close to close the dialog box. Use this option if you want to make more changes to the plan, or if you want to save the plan before you run it. Click Close and Run to close the dialog box and run the plan immediately. Remove Select the items you want to remove from your environment. 1. Choose the Remove action. 2. Navigate the list of items to choose which items you will remove. You can select individual items, or groups of items. 3. Click Remove . 4. When you have finished removing items in the plan&#8217;s load, close the dialog box. Click Close to close the dialog box. Use this option if you want to make more changes to the plan, or if you want to save the plan before you run it. Click Close and Run to close the dialog box and run the plan immediately. Change Resource Utilization Use this to see what will happen if the VMs in your environment were to consume a different amount of resources. For example, you can set the scope of your plan to a production cluster, increase the load by 20%, and run a plan. This is the same as saying, &#8220;What would happen if all the VMs in my production cluster saw a 20% increase in their consumption of host memory and CPU cycles?&#8221; This option is for VMs, only. Select the VMs you want to reallocate, and raise or lower the resource utilization by percentage points. 1. Choose the Change Resource Utilization action. 2. Navigate the list of VMs to choose which ones you will change. You can select individual VMs, or groups of VMs. Ctrl-click to select multiple items. 3. Click Change Load . 4. When you have finished changing VMs in the plan&#8217;s load, close the dialog box. Click Close to close the dialog box. Use this option if you want to make more changes to the plan, or if you want to save the plan before you run it. Click Close and Run to close the dialog box and run the plan immediately.

For capacity, you specify the IOPS (input operations per second) and latency in ms that your storage devices can support. Then the constraint settings identify what percentage of this capacity Operations Manager should consider when triggering problems. For example, assume IOPS Capacity of 500, and Latency of 1000 ms. If a storage device has 250 IOPS, then it is at 50% of capacity for that metric. Likewise, if the storage latency is 750 milliseconds, then the latency is at 75% of capacity.

After running this scenario, the table shows a target of 19 hosts, compared to the current environment that uses 25. To achieve 19 hosts, the plan suggests you add two new hosts, and suspend eight of the old ones. The table also shows that the target environment supports 223 VMs, to account for the 20 VMs we added in the setup. Plan Improvements This pane shows charts that compare the current environment to the target in terms of the device type and metrics you choose to plot. To see actual values in tooltips, hover over the data points in the chart. Use the following tools to control the chart display: Choose the type of device to plot &#8212; Hosts or datastores.

Supply_Chain_Terminology.html	Supply_Chain_Terminology.html	157239	6	2403	Supply Chain Terminology VMTurbo introduces specific terms to express IT resources...	VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Supply Chain Terminology	Supply Chain Terminology VMTurbo introduces specific terms to express IT resources and utilization in terms of supply and demand. These terms are largely intuitive, but you should be sure you understand how they relate to the issues and activities that are common for IT management. Term: Definition: Commodity The basic building block of VMTurbo supply and demand. Everything a VMTurbo product represents or analyzes is a commodity. For example, the CPU capacity or memory that a physical machine can provide is a commodity. The Operations Manager can also represent clusters and segments as commodities. When the user interface shows commodities , it&#8217;s showing the resources a service provides. When the interface shows commodities bought , it&#8217;s showing what that service consumes. Composed Of The resources or commodities that make up the given service. For example, in the user interface you might see that a certain VM is composed of commodities such as one or more physical CPUs, an Ethernet interface, and physical memory. Compare Composed Of to Consumes , where consumption refers to the commodities the VM has bought. Also compare Composed Of to the commodities a service offers for sale. A physical machine might include four CPUs in its composition, but the commodities the machine offers will show these CPUs aggregated as a single commodity. Consumes The services and commodities a service has bought. A service consumes other commodities. For example, a VM consumes the commodities offered by a physical machine, and an application consumes commodities from one or more VMs. Note that in the user interface you can explore the services that provide the commodities the current service consumes. Environment The sum of data center, network, physical machine, storage, VM, and application resources that you are monitoring. Inventory The list of all commodities in your environment. Utilization Index A measure of the risk to Quality of Service (QoS) that a consumer will experience. The higher the UI on a provider, the more risk to QoS for any consumer of that provider&#8217;s services. For example, a physical machine provides host services to one or more VMs. The higher the UI on the provider, the more likely it is that the VMs will experience QoS degradation. Note that for optimal operation, the UI on a provider should not go into double digits. In the above example, if the PM has a UI of 16 or more, the VMs are very likely to suffer QoS degradation. Service A functioning commodities group such as a physical machine, a VM, or an application. Utilization The percentage over time that a commodity is used, where 100% is utilization of the full capacity. VM Group The collection of VMs running on a given physical machine. Because an environment can have many VMs, the user interface shows VM groups as a way to simplify and organize their presentation. Copyright &copy; 2010 - 2013, VMTurbo All rights reserved

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: The Deploy View	The Deploy View Use the Deploy View to add VMs to your environment. For example if you need to deploy more applications, you can use this view to calculate where to place new VMs and actually deploy them in your environment. In this way, Operations Manager provides end-to-end intelligent workload management, from specifying actions to keep your environment in the Optimal Operating Zone, to deploying new VMs in the optimal locations, as calculated by Operations Manager. There are two ways to specify resource allocation and other details for the VMs you will deploy: Choose templates that are built from discovered data Many hypervisors store source VMs, and copy data from those source files to deploy new VMs. Operations Manager discovers these source VMs to build templates that you can choose on the Deploy View. Note that discovered templates are read-only &#8212; you cannot edit these templates. Choose templates that have been authored in Operations Manager You can create and edit templates that specify your VM configuration, and use those to specify resources for the new VMs. NOTE: TERMINOLOGY ISSUE &#8212; Some hypervisors refer to source VMs as templates. Within Operations Manager, templates are files that describe a VM, host, or datastore. For this topic, the word template refers to an Operations Manager template. VM Templates specify the resources allocated for a VM, and Deployment Profiles specify details such as the datacenter or cluster to host the new VM, and the package files (OVF or VHD) for the source VM. The term source VM refers to the VM deployment data that is stored on a hypervisor. The data in a VM template specifies the resources to allocate for the deployed VMs. When Operations Manager looks for the appropriate host for the VM, it looks for a host that can best provide these resources. The following topics describe how to use the Deploy view: Deploying VMs Creating and Editing Templates Copyright &copy; 2010 - 2013, VMTurbo All rights reserved	 				Deploying_VMs.html#50602011_649420 Creating_and_Editing_Templates.html#50602011_626275 
The_Economic_Scheduling_Engine.html	The_Economic_Scheduling_Engine.html	157239	4	2310	The Economic Scheduling Engine Operations Manager tracks the Utilization Index (UI)...	VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: The Economic Scheduling Engine	The Economic Scheduling Engine Operations Manager tracks the Utilization Index (UI) for specific resources in your environment. The higher this index, the more that resource is utilized, the greater the delay for consumers of that resource, and the greater the risk to your QoS. Operations Manager constantly works to keep the UI within acceptable bounds. You can think of UI as the cost for a resource&#8212;Operations Manager works to keep the cost at a competitive level. This is not simply a matter of responding to threshold conditions. Operations Manager analyzes the full range of buyer/seller relationships, and each buyer constantly seeks out the most economical transaction that is available. This last point is crucial to understanding Operations Manager. The virtual environment is dynamic, with constant changes to workload and optimal workload distribution that correspond with the varying requests your customers make of your applications and services. By examining each buyer/seller relationship, the economic engine arrives at the optimal workload distribution for the current state of the environment. For example, assume a PM that hosts one VM with a critical application, and two VMs with non-critical applications. Consider these similar situations: The critical application has increased use, and the non-critical applications are dormant In this case, Operations Manager can suspend the two unused VMs (reduce VM sprawl) and devote more host resources to the critical application. The critical application has increased use, and both non-critical applications see increased use In this case, Operations Manager can move the non-critical VMs to another host and devote more host resources to the critical application. This is an over-simple case, but it illustrates the value of constant analysis of all the relationships. For the critical application, the results are the same. But for the environment as a whole, the results arrive at different, economical solutions, to reflect the given conditions. The economic engine considers all the entities and resources in your environment, and analyzes them asynchronously to constantly tend toward the optimal operating zone. NOTE: In principal, you can run Operations Manager with nothing more than its default settings. However, it&#8217;s likely that your environment has special services and resources that require different management decisions. Operations Manager provides a full range of policies that you can set to control how the software manages specific groups of entities. However, before you make such policy settings, you should understand how Operations Manager works by default. For more information about policies, see The Policy View .

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: The Market and Virtual Currency	The Market and Virtual Currency To perform intelligent workload management, Operations Manager models the environment as a market, and uses market analysis to manage resource supply and demand. For example, bottlenecks form when local workload demand exceeds the local capacity&#8212;in other words, when demand exceeds supply. By modeling the environment as a market, Operations Manager can use economic solutions to efficiently redistribute the demand or increase the supply. Operations Manager uses two sets of abstraction to model the environment: Modeling the physical and virtual IT stack as a service supply chain The supply chain models devices in your environment as managed entities. These include applications, VMs, host machines (physical machines, or PMs), and data centers. Every entity is a buyer and/or a seller. A host machine buys physical space, power, and cooling from a data center. The PM sells host resources such as CPU cycles and memory to VMs. In turn, VMs buy host services, and then sell their hosting services (VMem and VCPU) to applications. Using virtual currency to represent delay or QoS degradation, and to manage the supply and demand of services along the modeled supply chain. The system uses virtual currency to value these buy/sell transactions. Each managed entity has a running budget, and draws from that budget to pay for the resources it consumes. The price of a resource is driven by its utilization &#8212; the more demand for a resource, the higher its price. Modeling the Environment as a Market These abstractions open the whole range of the environment to a single mode of analysis&#8212;market analysis. Resources and services can be priced to reflect changes in supply and demand, and pricing can drive resource allocation decisions. For example, a bottleneck (excess demand over supply) results in rising prices of the given resource. Applications competing for the same resource can lower their costs by shifting their workloads to other resource suppliers. As a result, utilization for that resource even out across the environment and the bottleneck is resolved. Copyright &copy; 2010 - 2013, VMTurbo All rights reserved

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: The Operations Manager Supply Chain	The Operations Manager Supply Chain Operations Manager models your environment as a market of buyers and sellers. At its simplest, a market model could classify each entity as just a buyer and a seller. However, a virtual environment has tiers of resources and services. Also, different targets that Operations Manager can monitor represent different tiers or groupings. For example, a hypervisor represents applications, VMs, PMs, data stores, and data centers, while a load balancer represents virtual applications and a cloud stack represents virtual data centers. These tiers form a chain of supply and demand, where one tier supplies resources to meet the demands of another tier. The Operations Manager user interface displays the supply chain in the following tiers. To see the full inventory, with navigation lists that show the full supply chain, see The Inventory View .

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: The Optimal Operating Zone	The Optimal Operating Zone The goal of workload management is to assure performance while maintaining efficient use of resources. When performance and efficiency are both maintained, you are in the optimal operating zone. You can measure performance as a function of delay, where zero delay gives the ideal QoS for a given service. Efficient use of resources is a function of utilization where 100% utilization of a resource is the ideal for the most efficient utilization. If you plot delay and utilization, the result is an asymptotic curve. Up to a point, as you increase utilization, the increase in delay is slight. There comes a point on the curve where a slight increase in utilization results in an unacceptable increase in delay. On the other hand, there is a point in the curve where a reduction in utilization doesn&#8217;t yield a meaningful increase in QoS. The optimal operating zone lies within these points on the curve. You could set a threshold to post an alert whenever the upper limit is crossed. In that case, you would never react to a problem until delay has already become unacceptable. To avoid that late reaction you could set the threshold to post an alert before the upper limit is crossed. In that case, you guarantee QoS at the cost of over-provisioning&#8212;you increase operating costs and never achieve efficient utilization. Instead of responding after a threshold is crossed, Operations Manager analyzes the operating conditions and constantly recommends actions to keep the entire environment within the optimal operating zone. If you execute these actions (or let Operations Manager execute them for you), the environment will maintain operating conditions that assure performance for your customers, while saving you as much as possible by efficient utilization of your resources.

Using this analysis, it displays utilization charts and tables in a Summary panel. These summaries show metrics for your current configuration, as well as target metrics &#8212; the metrics you can achieve by performing the recommended actions to optimize system deployment. Beneath the Summary panel, Operations Manager shows a To Do list of recommended actions (see To Do Lists - Maintaining QoS for more information). You can use the Optimizer to analyze and proactively address problems related to workload and resource distribution among physical hosts and storage devices. Further, Optimizer can automatically perform most recommended actions that do not include changes to physical configurations of hosts or storage. Once you execute a recommended action, the environment changes. Operations Manager performs its analysis again and presents further actions you can perform to optimize your deployment. In this way, you can iteratively change your configuration and workload distribution to improve overall performance. As Operations Manager monitors and analyzes your environment, it uses specified thresholds to identify risks and opportunities that it will consider for planning and optimization.

A scenario shows a summary of your target environment, utilization charts for your resources, as well as recommended actions you can perform to achieve the target results. For example, assume you run a plan that adds virtual machines to a cluster. The summary might show that you gain a lower and more evenly spread utilization index if you add more virtual machines to a smaller number of physical hosts. The recommended actions would then indicate which hosts you can take offline, and how to distribute your virtual machines among the remaining hosts. To use the Planner, click the Plan view, then create and run plans. The following figure shows the Planner user interface, with these features: The summary shows that the target utilization index has been evened out across all the host machines. The green plot is the target index, while the bars on the chart indicate the current utilization index. You can display charts for utilization index, memory consumption, CPU percentage, IO utilization, and network utilization.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Use Cases	Use Cases The Planner is especially useful for system architects and system administrators. System architects can use Planner to investigate how to expand the physical and virtual inventory to the best effect. Planner can indicate how much new hardware to add, how to distribute VMs among clusters of hosts, and whether components of the proposed network will be over- or under-utilized. System administrators can use Planner to answer immediate questions. If you expect a surge in utilization or demand, you can use Planner to explore how to deploy new VMs that perform specific functions. The following sections show example scenarios that can address these use cases. Copyright &copy; 2010 - 2013, VMTurbo All rights reserved

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Utilization	Utilization Utilization specifies the percentage of a physical resource that you want to make available in the given plan. By default, hosts and data stores have utilization set to 100%. For a given plan, you can set the utilization to a lower value. For example, assume you have one data store that you want to share evenly for two clusters of VMs. Also assume that you are creating a plan for one of those clusters. In that case, you can set the data stores to 50% utilization. This saves storage resources for the other cluster that will use this storage. To set utilization: 1. Click the Advanced Options icon ( ) to open the advanced Planning Options dialog box. 2. Display the Set Utilization tab. 3. Choose which type of device to modify: Set Max Host Utilization Set Max Storage Utilization 4. Navigate the list to select the device you want to modify. 5.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: vCenter Annotation Grouping	vCenter Annotation Grouping vCenter Server annotations are a way for users to classify their VMs according to custom names. For example, the vCenter administrator may use tags for Department, Owner, and Team. Each one of these tags is a way to classify the VMs. The administrator can then assign values to each tag, which further classifies the VMs. For example, the VMs can be grouped into two departments as a way to distinguish VMs for Sales from VMs for Development. Operations Manager can use these annotations to manage vCenter VMs in groups. The following figure shows two departmental groups. This corresponds to the VMs in vCenter that have been given either Demo or Engineering values for their Department annotations. Note that Operations Manager fully recognizes these groups. You can set scope (for user accounts or plans), generate reports, and use other group-related features.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Virtual Application	Virtual Application A virtual application is the logical application server (sometimes called a vserver) that a load balancer uses to marshall access to load-balanced applications. In the load balancer, each virtual application has bindings to the applications it manages. End users make requests to the virtual application, and the load balancer forwards those requests to the actual applications. Synopsis Budget: A virtual server has unlimited budget to buy application resources. As a result, a virtual application will never be suspended. Provides: Transactions to end users and other applications. Consumes: Applications running on VMs. Discovered through: Operations Manager discovers virtual application servers through load balancer targets (see Adding and Removing Target Virtual Management Servers ). Operations Manager displays virtual applications in the inventory as follows: Virtual Applications Load balancers manage the traffic of requests to applications in your environment. The virtual application is a logical construct of the load balancer. For information about binding load-balanced applications to the virtual application, see Discovery Policies . Operations Manager does not recommend actions to perform on the virtual application itself, but it does recommend actions to perform on the VMs that host bound applications. For example, assume a virtual application that manages three SQL databases. If a surge in requests degrades performance across all three databases, then Operations Manager can start a new VM to run another instance of the database application, and bind it to the virtual application. On the other hand, if SQL requests drop off so that the load balancer only forwards requests to two of the databases, Operations Manager can suspend the dormant database and unbind it from the virtual application.

VMTurboOperationsManagerUsersGuide: Virtual Machines	Virtual Machines A virtual machine (VM) is a software emulation of a physical machine, including OS, virtual memory and CPUs, and network ports. Synopsis Budget: A VM gains its budget by selling resources to the applications it hosts. The more activity there is on its hosted applications, the more budget the VM has to purchase resources from its physical host. If utilization is high enough, Operations Manager can create a new copy of the given VM. If utilization falls off, the VM loses budget. Ultimately, if the budget isn&#8217;t enough to pay for the host services it consumes, Operations Manager will suspend or power off the VM. Provides: Host resources for applications to use: VMEM (Kbytes) VCPU (MHz) VStorage IOPs (storage access operations per second) Latency (capacity for disk latency in ms) Consumes: Physical host resources, including CPU, Mem, and Storage. Discovered through: Operations Manager discovers VMs through hypervisor targets (see Adding and Removing Target Virtual Management Servers ). Operations Manager displays VMs in the inventory as follows: Virtual Machines Note that the inventory groups VMs by the physical machines that host them. In the user interface, this is a logical grouping that makes it easier to visualize the distribution of VMs across your environment.
