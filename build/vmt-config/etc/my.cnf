# Production run configuration suggestions

# The following configuration options should replace existing options in the my.cnf file
# or may be provided in a custom .cnf file as appropriate.
#
# All suggested changes are for the [mysqld] block, which is read by the mysqld process
# Other blocks are used by other applications (e.g. [myisamchk] or [mysql_dump] and
# may also benefit from similar changes. I have not provided recommendations for those
# applications here.
