/**
 * Merge a pair of entity instances down onto a single instance.
 *
 * The specific semantics of how a merge is performed can be tuned, but the general idea is that entities are merged
 * in pairs. One instance in the pair (the "from" entity) will be removed from the topology at the end of the merge
 * and the other instance (the "onto" entity) will be kept at the end of the merge.
 *
 * Any entities buying from the "from" entity before the merge will buy from the "onto" entity after the merge.
 *
 * Control the merge of individual fields by adding an {@link EntityFieldMerger}.
 * Field mergers are run in the order in which they are added to the list of field mergers.
 * Field mergers are run prior to merging commodities sold.
 *
 * Commodities sold are merged using a {@link com.vmturbo.stitching.utilities.MergeEntities.MergeCommoditySoldStrategy}.
 * By default, the strategy will keep distinct commodities sold (where uniqueness is determined by the combination of
 * a commodity's type and its key), and in the case of an overlap where both the "from" and "onto" are selling
 * the same commodity, the commodity sold by the "onto" entity is kept.
 *
 * Merging FROM an entity ONTO itself results in a no-op.
 * Merging FROM an entity NOT IN the topology ONTO an entity IN the topology results in a no-op.
 * Merging ONTO an entity NOT IN the topology results in an exception.
