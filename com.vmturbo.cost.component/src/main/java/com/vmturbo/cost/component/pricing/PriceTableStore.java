 * The persistence and retrieval layer for price tables discovered by the Topology Processor
 * via the Cost probes.

 * <p>Individual cost probes discover price tables. The Topology Processor is responsible for
 * uploading the price tables - one per probe type - to the cost component. The
 * {@link PriceTableStore} keeps the price tables safe and secret, and provides a retrieval
 * mechanism for the global price table that can be used for cost calculation.
 *
 * <p>Note: Right now (Aug 20, 2018) in the first stage of the Cloud in XL design, each cost probe
 * discovers a price table for every target, but the price tables are the same across targets for
 * the same probe type (e.g. AWS, Azure). This is why we store them organized by probe type
 * instead of target ID.
