/**
 * Data type to store Adjustment values for an inventory RI in terms of number of coupons  so that
 * they can be applied across separate Regional Contexts. In Azure, the same RI can be applied to
 * more than one regional context. The reason being Azure RIs are platform flexible - i.e. can be
 * applied to Windows/Linux/Suse/RHEL VMs.
 * For eg. So zonalContext1, zonalContext2 -> regionalContext1 and
 * zonalContext3,zonalContext4 -> regionalContext2. The only difference between them is OS.
 * So an RI which is applicable to regionalContext1 is also applicable to regionalContext2 in Azure.
