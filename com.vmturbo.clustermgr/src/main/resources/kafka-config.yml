# This file specifies the kafka configuration we want applied to the brokers during cluster setup.
# the format is:
#
# topics:
#   - topic: <name>  // the name of a topic we want created in the broker
#     <property-name>: <value> // each property-name / value combination will be applied as a topic-
#     <...>                    // specific property setting.
#
# In addition, we are using the following broker-level settings. So if these settings are not
# set at the topic level, they will inherit these broker values:
#      log.retention.hours: ${KAFKA_LOG_RETENTION_HRS} # 24 hrs
#      message.max.bytes: ${KAFKA_MAX_MESSAGE_BYTES} # 67108864 bytes (64mb)
