/**
 * Reports the application startup time and application uptime (which is different from JVM uptime)
 * as scrapable metrics.
 *
 * Application startup time is primarily intended for diagnostics, performance analysis and
 * troubleshooting. E.g is the component taking an unusual amount of time to start up? Is it taking
 * longer than it used to?
 *
 * "Application uptime" is intended for diagnostics and can be used to detect components that have
 * crashed, by comparing uptimes across component instances. In a normal environment, all of the
 * application uptimes should show similar values since they are all initially started in the same
 * session. But if a component has crashed (and been auto-restarted as per our docker policy), it
 * will report a noticeably shorter uptime than the other components. So components with short
 * uptimes should be seen as likely to have either crashed or been manually reconfigured / restarted.
