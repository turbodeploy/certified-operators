/**
 * Convenience class to hold market recommended actions that should be merged
 * by an aggregation entity.
 * Aggregation entity is the single target for executing the grouped actions atomically
 * for all the entities that are controlled by the aggregation entity.
 * AggregatedAction is created by {@link AtomicActionMerger} when a new action plan is received
 * by the Action Orchestrator.
 *
 * <p>Example for WorkloadController W1 that
 * --> owns -> ContainerSpec CS1 --> aggregates --> Containers C1, C2, C3
 * and also
 * --> owns -> ContainerSpec CS2 --> aggregates --> Containers C4, C5, C6
 * and also
 * ---> aggregates ---> Containers C10, C11 (without container spec)
 *
 * Note: In container model, you can't have a WorkloadController that directly aggregates
 * containers with no intermediate ContainerSpec.
 * This example is simply to demonstrate that an Aggregated action can merge actions for entities
 * associated with de-duplication targets or without.
 *
 * If there are duplicated resize actions {A1::VCPU, A2::VMEM} on C1, {A3::VCPU,A4::VMEM} on C2
 * and duplicated A7::VCPU, A8::VCPU on C4 and C5 respectively
 * and also resize action A10::VMEM, A11::VCPU, A20::VMEM, A21::VCPU on C10, C20,
 * then the AggregatedAction will be as follows -
 *
 *               \---------     AggregatedAction - WorkloadController W1    -----------|
 *              /                      /                          \                     \
 *             /                      /                           \                     \
 *            /                      /                            \                     \
 *  DeDuplication - CS1          DeDuplication - CS2        Merge - C10            Merge - C11
 *           |                            |                       |                     |
 *           |                            |                       |                     |
 *           |                            |                       |                     |
 *   Actions - {A1,A2,A3, A4}     Actions - {A7, A8}      Actions - {A10, A11}  Actions - {A20, A21}
 *
 * The resulting Action DTO is depicted in {@link AtomicActionBuilder}.
