/**
 * Maintain a cache of entity severities. Refreshing the entire cache causes the recomputation of the
 * severity for every entity in the cache. Refreshing the cache when a single action changes updates
 * causes the recomputation of only the "SeverityEntity"
 * for that action (although this operation is not that much faster than a full recomputation because
 * it still requires an examination of every action in the {@link ActionStore}.
 *
 * The severity for an entity is considered the maximum severity across all "visible" actions for
 * which the entity is a "SeverityEntity".
 *
 * <p>The cache should be invalidated and refreshed when:
 * <ol>
 * <li>A new action arrives in the system
 * <li>The "visibility" of an existing action in the system changes. (Visibility defined as whether
 * the user can see it in the UI).
 * <li>An action transitions from READY to any other state.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>TODO(davidblinn): The work being done here is somewhat specific to the API. Consider
 * moving this responsibility to the API if possible.
