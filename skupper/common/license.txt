For the avoidance of doubt, in the event Licensee downloads Trial Software and subsequently executes and delivers an Order Schedule, the license granted hereby shall cease applying solely for the Evaluation Period and for trial and/or evaluation purposes only and shall instead remain subject to the terms of this Agreement applicable to Software generally.
2.2.	Order, Delivery and Copies. An order for Software licenses shall be delivered either by means of (a) an electronic mail from Turbonomic that will provide Licensee with a link to access Turbonomic’s web site and instructions for downloading the Software or (b) to the extent that Licensee is unable to download the Software, a CD or other electronic media with the Software.  In either case, the Software may be activated only by means of an electronic mail from Turbonomic that will provide Licensee with the license keys required to activate the Software (“License Keys”) for either the Evaluation Period or the applicable period set forth in an Order Schedule.  Delivery and acceptance of the Software shall be deemed to have been made upon Turbonomic sending Licensee the License Keys, regardless of whether Licensee actually uses the License Keys. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Licensee may make a reasonable number of copies of the Software for the sole purpose of backing-up and archiving the Software.  Each copy of the Software is subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and Licensee must retain all titles, trademarks, and copyrights as delivered in the original.
2.3.	Restrictions. Licensee’s use of the Software is limited to the equipment and operating system configurations specified in the Documentation, and other restrictions as are set forth on an Order Schedule.  Turbonomic and its suppliers reserve any and all rights, implied or otherwise, which are not expressly granted to Licensee hereunder, and retain all rights, title and interest in and to the Software.  Licensee shall not modify, adapt, resell, rent, lease, loan, create or prepare derivative works based upon the Software or any part thereof.  Licensee may not use the Software as a service bureau, as an application service provider, to perform consulting or training services for a third party or in any commercial time share arrangement. Licensee may not use the Software in contravention to any applicable laws or government regulations.  Licensee may not disclose or permit the disclosure of the results of any product benchmarking or other comparative analysis with respect to the Software or Services without Turbonomic's prior written consent.  Licensee shall not decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer the Software.  If the immediately foregoing provision is prohibited by applicable law, Licensee shall provide Turbonomic with a detailed prior written notice of any such intention to reverse engineer the Software and shall provide Turbonomic with a right of first refusal to perform such work. Licensee shall take all reasonable precautions to prevent unauthorized or improper use or disclosure of the Software.
2.4.	Subsidiaries.  Licensee may make the Software available to any Subsidiary if such use of the Software by Subsidiary is licensed in an Order Schedule subject to this Agreement, provided that all licensing restrictions are complied with in the aggregate by Licensee and Subsidiary, and that Licensee and Subsidiary are jointly and severally obligated and liable hereunder.
2.5.	Free Trial; Authorizations.  Licensee may download and use Trial Software free of charge for the Evaluation Period, beginning upon receipt of the temporary License Key supplied by Turbonomic.  At the end of the Evaluation Period, the Trial Software will cease to function unless Licensee executes and delivers an Order Schedule.  Licensee hereby authorizes Turbonomic, during the Evaluation Period, to (i) collect, use and analyze configuration data from the environment where the Trial Software is installed, and (ii) associate configuration data with the account information you supplied in the license request process. Turbonomic may store this information at Turbonomic’s discretion for technical and business analysis purposes. Turbonomic will not disclose this information to unauthorized third parties without Licensee’s prior written consent.
2.6.	Product Diagnostic Reporting. Licensee acknowledges that the Software will store certain diagnostic information about the routine operations of the Software (including, without limitation, its performance, Licensee infrastructure topology, configuration data, and Software faults) and will periodically transmit this diagnostic information to Turbonomic. For clarity, no actual user data of Licensee is accessed, transmitted or provided to Turbonomic as part of this process (other than related to infrastructure topology), and no interruption of service is required to gather such detailed diagnostics.  Licensee agrees that Turbonomic has a perpetual, irrevocable, sublicenseable, and royalty-free right to use this diagnostic information in any manner (provided that information does not identify Licensee as the source of such information), and Licensee will not interfere with the collection or transmission of such information to Turbonomic.
3.	MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT SERVICES
During a Maintenance Period, Turbonomic will provide Licensee with Updates/Upgrades and the level of Maintenance and Support Services set forth in the applicable Order Schedule in accordance with Turbonomic’s then–current Maintenance and Support program as published from time to time on the product documentation section of Turbonomic’s website.  Maintenance and Support Services are provided only for the latest revision of the current and the one prior major release of the Software (e.g., if the most current major release is release 3.5.1 and the most current one prior release is release 2.4.2, only releases 3.5.1 and 2.4.2 will be supported, which will not, for the avoidance of doubt, include release 1.x), and do not apply to any deliverables that may be provided by Turbonomic to Licensee as part of other professional services.  If Turbonomic provides support for earlier versions of the Software or for deliverables, such support will be treated, billed, and paid for, as other professional services in accordance with Turbonomic’s then current rates for such professional services.

IN NO EVENT WILL TURBONOMIC BE OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT SERVICES WITH RESPECT TO TRIAL SOFTWARE.

Other than with respect to Trial Software, Turbonomic shall defend Licensee (at Turbonomic’s expense) against any claim or suit brought by a third party against Licensee alleging that the Software, or any part thereof, infringes upon a copyright or misappropriate a trade secret of such third party.  Turbonomic shall pay any damages finally awarded to such third party by a court of competent jurisdiction resulting from such claim or suit, or agreed to in a written settlement by Turbonomic.
