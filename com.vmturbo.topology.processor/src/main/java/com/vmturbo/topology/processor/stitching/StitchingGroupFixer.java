/**
 * One type of topological change that can be performed during stitching is that multiple entities
 * with different OIDs may be merged into a single entity with a single OID. A side effect of this
 * is that references to the entity by one of the aliases it lost due to these merges during
 * stitching are invalidated. For further details on merges, see
 * {@link TopologyStitchingChanges.MergeEntitiesChange} and/or
 * {@link com.vmturbo.stitching.utilities.MergeEntities.MergeEntitiesDetails}.
 *
 * Now consider two Storages, one with OID 1234, and the other with OID 5678. During stitching,
 * suppose that Storage-5678 is merged onto Storage-1234 (as a result, Storage-5678 is removed and
 * Storage-1234 receives some of the properties of Storage-5678 but not its OID). Now suppose
 * that the target that discovered Storage-5678 included this entity as a member of a storage
 * cluster. As a result of this merge, the storage cluster now contains an invalid group member!
 * In order to fix the invalid reference, we should replace the OID 5678 with its new identifier
 * 1234.
 *
 * <p>Another example is the discovered virtual machine groups sent by kubeturbo. Assume a virtual
 * machine group VM-Group-1 contains one proxy virtual machine with OID VM-1234. After stitching,
 * the proxy virtual machine is stitched with the real virtual machine with OID VM-5678, and is then
 * removed. Because of this, we need the {@link StitchingGroupFixer} to replace the OID VM-1234 with
 * VM-5678 for the virtual machine group VM-Group-1.
 *
 * <p>The {@link StitchingGroupFixer} is shared by two pipeline stages:
 * The StitchingGroupAnalyzerStage uses the {@link StitchingGroupFixer} to scan the
 * {@link TopologyStitchingGraph} for merged entities that belonged to discovered groups, and cache
 * those groups whose members need to reference the post-stitched identities of those entities.
 * The UploadGroupsStage, in an atomic fashion, makes a deep copy of each discovered group, and
 * replaces the membership of those copied groups that need modification based on the cache stored
 * in {@link StitchingGroupFixer}, before uploading them to the group component.
