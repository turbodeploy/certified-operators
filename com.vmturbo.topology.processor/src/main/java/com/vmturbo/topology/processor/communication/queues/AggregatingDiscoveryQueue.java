/**
 * Interface for a queue of discovery items that will be run in the order they are queued up. This
 * queue guarantees that a particular discovery type and target will appear only once in the queue.
 * Subsequent attempts to add the same discovery will be noops.
 * A worker that actually runs the discoveries can pull entries off the queue by specifying the
 * probe types it supports and the discovery type it is performing.  It will get the earliest queued
 * discovery that meets those requirements.  It can call takeNextQueuedDiscovery to block until a
 * discovery is available or pollNextQueuedDiscovery to get back and empty discovery if none is
 * available.
 * Implementations of this class must be thread safe as multiple workers will be servicing it while
 * the OperationManager is feeding it.
