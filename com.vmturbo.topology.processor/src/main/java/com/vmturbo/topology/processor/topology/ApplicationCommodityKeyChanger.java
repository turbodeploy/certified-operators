/**
 * The ApplicationCommodityKeyChanger is created specifically to overcome the bug OM-39541.
 * This bug is happening if there are vms that are replicated in the customer environment (which means
 * that they will have the same uuid, but they are in separate targets).
 * Because of that, and because of how the probe is assigning the commodities key, each guestload app
 * in the replica vms will buy an ApplicationCommodity from the respective vm.
 * Today the commodity key is in the form: VirtualMachine::423f26a7-1132-df1c-64e2-8a040480b046
 * where the last part is the vm uuid.
 * Given that the replica vms have the same uuid, this also means that the guestload applications
 * that they have on top can buy from one vm or the other with no constraints, because the key is the same.
 * This is only an artifact of the probe key assignment, and the replica effect.
 * When we assign OIDs to those vms and applications, the assignment is correct, and each one will get its
 * own separate oid (so the guestload app is buying from the correct vm).
 * The problem is that the ApplicationCommodity key is not changed, so the guestload can potentially buy
 * also from the vm that he is not connected with. This can manifest itself because the scoping algorithm
 * can bring unexpected vms and hosts into the scoped topology.
 * In order to fix this issue, we are changing the commodity key of those vms and applications
 * to the vm oid, so that it's unique.
 * Note: for now we are doing this only for vms and applications, and only if the vm is selling
 * a single ApplicationCommodity. We are not covering the case when multiple of those are sold.
