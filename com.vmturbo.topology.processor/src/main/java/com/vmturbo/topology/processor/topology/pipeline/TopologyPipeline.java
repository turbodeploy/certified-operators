/**
 * A {@link TopologyPipeline} captures the different stages required to build and broadcast
 * a topology out of the topology processor. {@link TopologyPipeline}s are built in the
 * {@link LivePipelineFactory} for realtime pipelines, and {@link PlanPipelineFactory} for
 * plan pipelines.
 *
 * <p>The pipeline consists of a set of {@link Stage}s. The output of one stage becomes
 * the input to the next {@link Stage}. State can be shared between stages by attaching
 * and dropping members on the {@link TopologyPipelineContext}. Context state sharing is configured
 * when defining the "providesToContext" and "requiresFromContext" of individual stages in the pipeline (see
 * {@code Stage#requiresFromContext(PipelineContextMemberDefinition)} and
 * {@code Stage#providesToContext(PipelineContextMemberDefinition, Supplier)}.
 * The stages are executed one at a time. In the future we can add parallel execution of certain subsets of
 * the pipeline, but that's not necessary.
 *
 * @param <I> The input to the pipeline. This is the input to the first stage.
 * @param <O> The output of the pipeline. This is the output of the last stage.
