     * relates to the BApp because the BApp might be at risk due to the congestion on PM_Host.
     * If BApp was hosted on PM_Other instead, then BApp is unaffected by the move
     * action, because the Market will recommend actions that are safe for the destination.</li>
     * <li>For move VM_other from PM_Host to PM_Other due to compliance, we should not include the action.
     * Even though the BApp is hosted on PM_Host, the compliance issue has nothing to do with
     * the BApp. However, if BApp was hosted on VM_other, then the compliance issue puts the
     * BApp at risk.</li>
