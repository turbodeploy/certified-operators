The folders underneath the "dashboards" folder will be created in Grafana at extractor startup.

Inside each folder there can be a "permissions.json" file which will specify permission overrides
for the folder (see: https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/http_api/folder_permissions/)

The other .json files inside each folder are assumed to be Grafana dashboards, and will be created
or updated in Grafana under the appropriate folder.

Rules for Dashboards:

1) DO NOT change the UID for dashboards! This is what gets used to detect duplicates. This also
gets used for saved links, so changing the UID will break any bookmarks the customers have to
specific dashboards.

2) Do not include references to specific datasources. Leave as "null" to use the default
data source.

3) For "templating", delete the "current" object, and the "options" (if they are dynamically
generated - e.g. a list of possible groups/clusters).

BEFORE (in JSON model):
"templating": {
    "list": [
      {
        "current": {
          "selected": false,
          "text": "test-timescale",
          "value": "test-timescale"
        },
        "hide": 0,
        "includeAll": false,
        "label": null,
        "multi": false,
        "name": "DB",
        "options": [],
        "query": "postgres",
        "refresh": 1,
        "regex": "",
        "skipUrlSync": false,
        "type": "datasource"
      }
    ...

AFTER:
"templating": {
    "list": [
      {
        "hide": 0,
        "includeAll": false,
        "label": null,
        "multi": false,
        "name": "DB",
        "options": [],
        "query": "postgres",
        "refresh": 1,
        "regex": "",
        "skipUrlSync": false,
        "type": "datasource"
      }
    ...

4) Remove the "id" and "version" fields - they will be unique per installation. You can leave the
"uid" field.

5) Remove any explicit "time" fields - they are unique to each installation. e.g.:

  "time": {
    "from": "2020-01-01T06:00:00.000Z",
    "to": "2020-01-01T06:59:00.000Z"
  },
