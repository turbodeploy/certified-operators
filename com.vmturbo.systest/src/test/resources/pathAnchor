This file exists to be an "anchor" from which to find the docker-compose.yml files
(and any other files the tests need) in the repository.

In JUnit with IntelliJ the default working directory is the location of the *.iml file, which
can be anywhere. We also can't use absolute paths because different developers have
environments set up differently. The solution is to start from this file, and navigate
to the right place.
