The "pathAnchor" file exists to be an "anchor" from which to find the docker-compose.yml files
(and any other files the tests need) in the repository.

This particular instance is here to support unit tests related to the use of the "pathAnchor" file,
such as DockerEnvironmentTest.testGetComposeFilesPath()

In JUnit with IntelliJ the default working directory is the location of the *.iml file, which
can be anywhere. We also can't use absolute paths because different developers have
environments set up differently. The solution is to start from this file, and navigate
to the right place.
